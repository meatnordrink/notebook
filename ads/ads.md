# Ads


## Questions for Ashley: 
### FB:
* What is the best strategy for introducing a new ad variation? In existing group, as own group? How about totally new creative? (Should I a/b, if I still can?)
* I've been hesitant to turn off ads which are performing less well, but still okay, within a group, for fear that, when the currently more successful ad has to spend more of the budget, it's performance will decline as well; and as the algorithm may be adapting the ad for slightly different groups, it will actually result in reduced spend overall. Is this correct? What's the best way to respond to an ad that's performing particularly well within a FB ad set?  
### GA: 

# FB

### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25
* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 
* Aug 2019: Instagram Feed Ads bombed.
* Desktop only - July 2019. Failed badly. Could try with more targeted creative/to specific audiences. 
* "Download" CTA doesn't seem to do as well as 'learn more' or 'sign up'.

### Testing

* New IG Stories ad group, Sept. 19th. If does okay, experiment with different call-to-actions for best ads. 
 * If these don't spend, consider forcing spend by running as an a/b.
   - New sparkler group bombed. Re-introducing older woman-pic ads that never caught on as a separate ad group, on 9/27. **Check**
   - Added new ad group, non-full ads. (Did re-use the same woman-looking-down creative...overlap? But IG Stories users are not necessarily the same as FB feed...)
   - Also changed audience from signed-up to onboard-end.
* New Sept creative for onboard-end, sign-up. Experiment calls to action, shift evidence (see below) or free text to forefront.
  * **Check**
  * Added Evidence creative group as new ad group. **Check** Not sure this was the best way to add this, as a new group as opposed to new ads in existing campaigns. 
 * Whatever does well from this or IG Stories, try on retargeting groups. 
* Put all retargeting in one campaign; added a group retargeting for pageviews.
--pageviews failed to spend; created a new campaign with a custom conversion for website loads.  
* **CHECK** Turned off old ad group in signed-up campaign; check to see that spend is still good. If average CPA goes near $2, turn it back on. 


### To check/Do
* natural depression campaign

* For retargeting: Think on, come up with some ideas for best content to serve to retargeting audiences. Run a/b's, perhaps. 

* Think on/discuss best way of adding new creative. Keep budget optimization? Split budgets? 

* REST OF ASHLEYS REC'S: Carousel, regional (also, try to get Google to whitelist us for audiences.)

* See if woman w phone in onboard end continues to heavily outperform other creative. if so....how to respond? Ask Ashley. (Should the algorithm just automatically adjust for that? If it isn't, does it mean it's already getting all the low-cost conversions it can with it? See Q above.)
* If sign-up audience ultimately seems better than onboard-end, aim Instagram at that. (Consider keeping onboard-end, but with a lower bid cap.)

* Next - try putting IG stories creative in FB feed ads;they had low costs there. (cross competition; same audience..?) (maybe just the images...?)
* If costs remain high on two main campaigns, reduce target bids. 

* (Sept. 10) Added "evidence-focus" ads to retargeting campaigns. **Check**
    * Seem to be doing very well (Sept. 19th) - try on other campaigns when results of new pics in. 
    --In progress
* Test IG ads targeted solely at men (perhaps in a certain region, to go with regional campaign; and exclude from other campaigns.)

* Look through; if ads consistently run badly on weekends, turn off then. 

### Next
* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.) -- IN PROGRESS
* Vary text in creative. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try dynamic creative again.

* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a carousel; or static text with pics of diverse people cylcing through. Try running it on Instagram. 
* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)
* Try busting out most successful ads into own campaigns --(Why, again? Maybe check on Search Focused.pdf)

* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.

* Consider setting the target of the retargeting-purchases campaign as pageviews. 

# RETARGETING CAMPAIGNS (FB Only)
## In Progress

## To-do: 
* Launch retarget campaign for IG
* Check analytics for sign-ups, purchases for 'clicked' campaign once `utm_source` parameters are passing through sign-up. 
* "" for 'bought' campaign; currently very little visibility past landing page here, as most users will skip the onboard entirely. 

## Findings
* For the "clicked" audiences, where the metrics work well, looks like the Google and FB #'s match up perfectly. 



# Google

## Tested
* Responsive ads - not great so far. Not horrible, but worse than expanded text. Tried in Depression BMM;Depression General, and Mood Journal EM & BMM;Mood Tracker. In the latter, increased spend, but at very high CPR.
    - but, seem to be working in CBT campaigns??
### Keywords Tested: 
* Free Mood Tracking (No spend as of Aug 2019)
* (Neg) `+CBT +Self +Online` - spent nothing.

## In Progress: 

* See below.
*Increased target spend modestly for October. If CPA holds steady for the first week of Oct (presuming cost increases), continue to increase $$ (for one or both campaigns.) 

**NEXT** - Stop campaigns that aren't spending much, but have high CPA?
               - **Try creating Responsive ads for them first, monitor**
         - Anxiety campaign, post-partum depression campaigns?
         - check out if extensions are changeable
         - `Dep EMM: Overcome Dep`, add some ads. Diff link, explicit price, evidence-based (same set as in `Dep EMM: Dep gen`) 
         - Go to `Dep BMM` campaign, look at any other campaigns with matches; if "how" etc's, add how to exact match, exclude from broad. 
         - Maybe take a break from breaking out campaigns for a bit, check other things; entirely new campaigns, perhaps. Call to try to get whitelisted...

## To check on: 

* See above. 

* Added "how to not be depressed" campaigns; **check on**

* Check how exact-match group's spend look after Oct 1st; increase if it's spending close to $20. 

* (Sep 9) Added explicit price ad variant to `depression BMM; depression general`. ***Check***
   - Explicit cost ad seems to be doing well. Copied to: 
     * `depression EMM: depression general`
	 * `CBT BMM: all groups` (customized)
* Added Responsive ads to CBT EMM campaign, both ad groups. 
       - Not doing as well in `depression EMM: dep gen`, but okay. Not much in `CBT BMM`, but a little; seems worthwhile, as any uptick in that campaign is hard to come by. 



**Get out of depression**:
* (Check EMM; doing better than BMM.) Looks like `depression/program` does better than `get_out_of/depression`. Changed several to this (Sept 18). If this pattern continues, try a/b'ing rational (rather than relevance-focussed) url's on other, large campaigns (where they aren't).
**Depression Help**: 
 * Added second ad. 
 * See neg. below
 * Try breaking out a campaign for `how to help {x} with depression`
**Depression self-help**: 
* Added `self-help` negative keyword to `depression help`; see if performance improves. (9/18)
**Fight Depression**
* Lots of ad variants. Check out. 
**CBT BMM: All groups**
* Added explicit price ad. 
* Consider turning off responsive search ad on `CBT` group. Left on for now, as it's increasing spend for the account, I think...but it's costing significantly more. 
**How to get out of depression**
* Created, Sept. 19th. Check on gen performance, ad variants. If doing well, create a 'coping' campaign, provided it's still the top search term in gen depression.


* Switched to monthly budgeting for main campaign, 9/18. Check out. 
* Increased budget from 1620 to 1520, Sept. 18. 
* Re: above - maybe just try a campaign for `how to ... depression` [fight cope get rid not be snap out pull yourself out]

## To try:
* Fr Eddie/Trends - "Depression test"

* Look at Google Guy's advice, think through application

* Check out Google Trends, apply

* natural depression campaign

* depression therapy campaign

* break out cognitive behavioral therapy from cbt?

* Look at trying east-us specific campaign? Locationally specific? 
* Consider - are BMM campaigns for keywords broken out from BMM really worthwhile? (They don't seem to spend...but if the cpr is okay, then that's fine.)
* Different bid strategies (Target ROAS?)
* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`
* Try customizing extensions to match ads for better relevance scores. 
* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
	* Expand on this - try deep-linking at some point; ask Danielle how possible it is. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
* `How to`...`depression naturally` campaign. (Check out `Beat depression` for example search terms.)




# Q's for Ashley

* Since Aug 28th 2019, started disabling campaigns that were spending little but doing nothing. Cool?
* Different bid strategies?








		* Figure out why the app install campaign isn't performing. Says no download conversion action is set up; figure out how to do this. (Ask Ashley.)
			* Set up app conversion event for Google Play installs, once we're actually listed on the Play store. 

		* Create anxiety campaign
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.  


# Conclusions (some tentative)


## FB
* Instagram ads seem to have higher cost-per-onboard-end, but lower per sign-up. Yay. (July '19, preliminary) (Aug 27 - but this seems to be dropping; prob necessary to keep creative varied.)
* Sign-up audience is slightly underperforming onboard-end audience...but it might be worth it to have a different audience to aim at, to increase spend. (July '19, preliminary - will sign-ups improve after I winnow the ads?)
