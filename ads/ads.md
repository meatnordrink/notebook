# Ads

A few large ad goals, to figure out how to measure/address with a pro: 
* Need to clarity all through funnel for retargeting and instagram; should we abandon these? They have higher costs early on, but maybe they do better later in the funnel?

## Questions for Ashley: 
### FB:
* What is the best strategy for introducing a new ad variation? In existing group, as own group? How about totally new creative? (Should I a/b, if I still can?)
* I've been hesitant to turn off ads which are performing less well, but still okay, within a group, for fear that, when the currently more successful ad has to spend more of the budget, it's performance will decline as well; and as the algorithm may be adapting the ad for slightly different groups, it will actually result in reduced spend overall. Is this correct? What's the best way to respond to an ad that's performing particularly well within a FB ad set?  
* RE: Regional targeting - the ideas is I'm supposed to exclude NY targeting from my other campaigns, yeah, so I'm not competing against myself? But is it a good idea to turn off advertising in a large market, with a campaign with lots of accumulated learning, in favor of a campaign with no learning, and with a very different pitch? (The changes are not small.)
### GA: 
* Google Regional Targeting: Does this make any sense? No one searches "depression in New York", really. Seasonal Depression might be regionally specific; but won't searching be self-selecting? (Like, if someone searches it, I don't really care where they are; not many people in areas that don't have seasonal changes are going to do the search.) So I'm kinda' assuming this doesn't apply to us.
* I'm using Target CPA on Google Ads, which supposedly uses "smart bidding." Will this take locations most likely to convert into account automatically, or is geo-targeting still necessary?


## Broad Notes
* Nov 1st, 2019: Turned down ads significantly, based on poor income #'s. If #'s improve, raise again *slowly.* Watch out for a/b's that may mess things up. 

# FB

***Notes of the moment:*** Consider following Adexpresso's suggestion to start new campaigns using CBO at a smaller budget for 4-7 days to let the algorithm figure shit out before scaling. 
* Try dialect ads?
*  
* Try a broader audience; one article mentioned that FB has recently shifted favor to broadly-targeted campaigns. 
* Re-examine audiences for retargeting; consider increasing size. 


### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25
* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 
* Aug 2019: Instagram Feed Ads bombed.
* Desktop only - July 2019. Failed badly. Could try with more targeted creative/to specific audiences. 
* "Download" CTA doesn't seem to do as well as 'learn more' or 'sign up'.

### Testing

* *IG stories:*
  * Switching from `signed-up` audience to `onboard-end` seems to have been good; costs have gone down to around $2, Oct 1-9th. 
  * Other two ad groups not spending; set a limit of $10 (of $15) on main ad group; check and see 1) if other ads spend a bit now, and 2) what their CPA is. 
    * Didn't work; still didn't really spend. `Old Sept pic` campaign spent a little, but not much and high CPA. Response: Added `woman looking down` ad from `evidence` group to `IG Stories` group (Oct 16th). See if that spends; add a full-image version. 
       * (Oct 24) Didn't. Stopped. If other campaigns don't spend, force an a/b test (and re-try these).
       * (Oct 24) Also, turned off campaign budget optimization, so that I can manually allocate amongst ad groups. (Might be worth re-trying some of those old ad groups under this system.)
       * **Or** - if not spending, first try setting a budget minimum for the new campaign. **Do**
  * (Oct 24) Created new IG stories creative. **check** variations. **do** -> select most successful, and try variations in: 
      * background color
      * text creative
      * font style/size
      Once this is done, try with similar but different photos in future months.
  * All sucking, kinda; **do** TRY A NEW CAMPAIGN WITH BASICALLY THE SAME IMAGE/TEXT AS THE OLD ONE, BUT DIFFERENT GIRL IN IMAGE


* *Retargeting:* 
 * Try breaking out signed-up retargeting and applying CBO to this whole campaign.
    * Did, 11/5. At this point, sign-up retargeting at .48/link click. 
    * If clicked-end campaign still spending high, delete an ad group and see if that allows you to lower spend. **check**
      * Broken-out signed-up doing okay, not great (Nov 11) but okay - .55. But remaining ads went to hell under CBO; lowered budget, if it doesn't correct, go back to manual budgeting. And check out the performance on the analytics; check costs-per. **do**
 * `signed-up`: Confirmed that it's performing much worse than `onboard end` retargeting audience. Removed all but one fern ad, added new creative with Sept. woman. remove fern if still performing poorly; or lower budget for entire campaign if all performing poorly.
    * New ads don't seem to have been approved?? Tried to re-publish, Oct. 16th; lowered budget to $3 for now.
        * Sucking hard, mostly; fern ad doing alright. But haven't spent much. 
            * Tried new tack; tried optimizing for link clicks. CPC and CPLC are actually good, the best of any; my thought is that it may be that, because people have already signed up, somehow the conversions aren't firing...maybe the go to the "already signed up?" link? That would actually make sense. 
                  * This seems to be working; (Oct 29) - getting the lowest cpc and cplc of any retargeting campaign. Normally, there would be cause for concern that it's targeting people unlikely to actually convert, just click; but these are people who have already signed up. 
                      * So: Continue to increase budget to a reasonable point, until/unless cpc/cplc increases (currently lowest on both, significantly.) To check effectiveness, check analytics to purchase, over a long period; but, this won't account for people that went to the app. May just have to increase budget and look at overall success.
               * Depending on how this goes, **check**
                   * Try another campaign aiming at this audience with a conversion event firing on the "already signed up?" link on the page. **do**
    * Think I can close all the above; after breaking out, one ad high; shut it off. If CPA doesn't go down below 50, further decrease budget. (Nov 11)

 * `clicked` : shifted most of budget to new creative.
   * New creative kicking old's butt. Result: Disabled all flower ads, left fern (best performing) at even lower budget; increased new creative's budget to $15. (Oct 16)
      * Oct 24 - One fern left in old campaign doing great; increased budget $2 to $3. Continue to increase slowly. **check**
      * Oct 24 - Created new ad group with explicit cost. If it doesn't bomb, a/b (actual split test) with a different headline. **check**
          * Old group catching up now, as costs increase for new creative; shifted some of the budget back (Oct 29).
             * Nothing really spending except new creative. Shut them down. Keep an eye on the girl-pic creative; spending a lot with no results in last 7 days, but best last 30. (Nov 19)


* *Onboard-End:* 
 * Added an explicit-cost + evidence group, Oct 24th.  If it does well, reproduce for signed-up audience.
    * After see the results from adding explicit-cost ad, increase budget slightly. (Oct 24)
        * Not doing great; turned off less performant ad. Kill if doens't improve. **do**

* *Signed-up:*
 * Removing old ad group seems to have been fine; costs have remained well below $2 (1.66, Oct 4-9th), and spend still looks good. Look at increasing spend slightly, on same terms as above. 
    * Evidence creative seems to be kicking ass; but campaign budget optimization is on, so it could just be that it's getting aimed at all the cheap conversions. Increased budget a touch, as planned; if non-evidence creative continues to have higher CPA, turn off and see if other costs increase. **check** **do** (Oct 24)

  * ONBOARD LOOKALIKE WAS NOT BEING EXCLUDED ON NEW CREATIVE AD GROUPS; EXCLUDED AND DRASTICALLY REDUCED SPEND. (Oct 29)
     * Doing well now; leave for a bit. When time for a budget increase, this is a good candidate. **do**
     * Adjusted relative balcnce with `onboard-end` : 40/10 to 38/12. (Nov 11)
* *Regionally Targeted*
  * Copy ideas: 
      - "There's more than one way to prepare for winter" "This isn't the only way to prepare for winter"... something like that. Image of some kind of winter prep. 
      - "It's important to prepare for winter." Squirrel image. "Take care of your mind this winter with UpLift, the first depression app of its kind."
      - Try positive first, then try negative. 
      - Positive: "Prepare yourself to make the most of this winter."
      - Negative: "Don't let seasonal depression prevent you from making the most of winter. 
      - Hybrid: Negative copy, positive image (winter fun in NY.)
      - See if I can target rural vs city; adjust images appropriately. (Looks like I can; perhaps, for first campaign, try targeting city; then try rural.)

  * Performing quite badly. Turned off all but two okay-performing ads; cloned an ad-group for US-New York City, seeing if just running them as fall ads helps. **check** Depending on the results of that, try just northern US.  
    * US-minus-NY group doing decent; NY-only not spending. Paused that, removed NY exclusion. (Nov 11)
      * Doing alright as pan-US. Disabled breakfast ad, as it had better CPC, but lower conversion (people probably thought it was for food.) (Nov 25)
  * **Do** Try winter-prep squirrel ad. (Target at northern US.)

* *Anxiety*
  * Started Oct 28. 
  * Doing well. Once a/b numbers in, made sure funnel is doing well, increase budget in $5/increments. **Do**


### To check/Do

* Think on maybe an Oceania campaign? Or, check what currencies we're getting paid in, and try a campaign targeting whatever's behind USD?

* For retargeting: Think on, come up with some ideas for best content to serve to retargeting audiences. Run a/b's, perhaps. 

* Think on/discuss best way of adding new creative. Keep budget optimization? Split budgets? 

* REST OF ASHLEYS REC'S: Carousel, regional (also, try to get Google to whitelist us for audiences.)

* See if woman w phone in onboard end continues to heavily outperform other creative. if so....how to respond? Ask Ashley. (Should the algorithm just automatically adjust for that? If it isn't, does it mean it's already getting all the low-cost conversions it can with it? See Q above.)

* Next - try putting IG stories creative in FB feed ads;they had low costs there. (cross competition; same audience..?) (maybe just the images...?)

* Test IG ads targeted solely at men (perhaps in a certain region, to go with regional campaign; and exclude from other campaigns.)

* Look through; if ads consistently run badly on weekends, turn off then. 

### Next
* Launch retarget for IG
* Try targeting life events
* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.) -- IN PROGRESS
* Vary text in creative. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try dynamic creative again.

* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a carousel; or static text with pics of diverse people cylcing through. Try running it on Instagram. 
* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)
* Try busting out most successful ads into own campaigns --(Why, again? Maybe check on Search Focused.pdf)

* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.

* Consider setting the target of the retargeting-purchases campaign as pageviews. 



# Google

## Tested
* Responsive ads - not great so far. Not horrible, but worse than expanded text. Tried in Depression BMM;Depression General, and Mood Journal EM & BMM;Mood Tracker. In the latter, increased spend, but at very high CPR.
    - but, seem to be working in CBT campaigns??
### Keywords Tested: 
* Free Mood Tracking (No spend as of Aug 2019)
* (Neg) `+CBT +Self +Online` - spent nothing.


### General musings: 
* Responsive ads seem to be useful for campaigns that aren't spending, but to perform poorly (cost more) on campaigns that are already doing alright. 

## In Progress: 

**STOPPING LOTS OF CAMPAIGNS/LOWERING BUDGETS** - Dec 11th, turned off Mood Journal (both), Brand BM; high spend Nov 1 - Dec 10. Lowered budget for others, on theory that FB ads are converting better. (Also, going into holidays may be a rough time.)

* Dec 11 overall - lowering CBT budgets; need to get to lower average costs. Examine more carefully in future, raise if I think we might do better. Lowered other campaigns, re: above point. 

**NEXT** - Stop campaigns that aren't spending much, but have high CPA?
               - **Try creating Responsive ads for them first, monitor**
         - Anxiety campaign, post-partum depression campaigns?
         - check out if extensions are changeable
         - `Dep EMM: Overcome Dep`, add some ads. Diff link, explicit price, evidence-based (same set as in `Dep EMM: Dep gen`) 
         - Go to `Dep BMM` campaign, look at any other campaigns with matches; if "how" etc's, add how to exact match, exclude from broad. 
         - Maybe take a break from breaking out campaigns for a bit, check other things; entirely new campaigns, perhaps. Call to try to get whitelisted...

## Budget: 

* Spend seems to be pretty solid under $2; added $100 to `Dep Gen BM`, $50 to `" " EM`. Hold steady for the rest of the month; expect a bit of a rise at the end of the month, then dip as the next one starts. 
* *If the increase at the end of the month is severe, lower the ad budget at the end of the month to constrain spend*

### Depression General Campaign (Oct 17th last check)

*Todo Next* 
  * Go through CBT exact, broad, post Nov 1st. CPA was very high; some ads/groups were spending a lot with no results. But, it was the end of the month. Reduced budget Nov 1st; see if pattern holds. If so, disable (such as `CBT App EM`.) But hopefully it was just burning through budget.
  * Try lowering target CPA...maybe try a/b'ing it with something. Or reading up on it more. It's $1.75 now, even on campaigns with much lower average costs...Would like lower average cost. (Dec 11)
  
**How to cope with depression**
* Baseline: As part of `depression general BMM`, this keyword had 10 conversions, at a cost of $1.62, over 3 months (Aug-Oct). *check* to see if breaking it out into an exact-match campaign improves upon this.
* Oct 30 start, from `dep gen`.

**How to beat depression**
* Started Oct 30; broke out from `beat depression`. *check*

**How to fight depression**
* Broke out from `fight depression` and `depression general`, Oct 30. *check*

**Get out of depression**:
* (Check EMM; doing better than BMM.) Looks like `depression/program` does better than `get_out_of/depression`. Changed several to this (Sept 18). If this pattern continues, try a/b'ing rational (rather than relevance-focussed) url's on other, large campaigns (where they aren't).
* BMM: 
  * `/depression/program` ads were all performing better than `get_out_of/depression` ads, so I disabled all but one, which was spending low, but good CPA. 
* EMM: 
  * Same as above, but disabled all. CPA was high for all but the top ad; should I shut down the higher-performing ads, or will they just spend less if I do? (Good Q for Ashley.) 
  * EMM are coming in with a higher CPA than BMM; why? Check what search terms BMM is getting, make sure ads are the same. (Perhaps most likely: Could be just that EMM has more conversions due to acquirable higher bids; had 79 conversions vs 39.) (Oct 17th) 
  * *Next* - Add explicit price variant to both EM and BMM

**Depression Help**: 
  * BMM: 
    * Try breaking out a campaign for `how to help {x} with depression`
  * EMM: 
    * Testimonial ad did well in BMM, added to EM (Oct 9). *check*
      * Testimonial add did well in both BMM and EM; added explicit price ad (to BMM as well), Oct. 17th. *check*

**Depression self-help**: 
* EM: 
  * Still not spending; nothing seems to have helped yet. 
  * Added new testimonial, another `/depression/program` variant. (Oct. 17th) *check*
  * If still not spending, look again at `depression general`, `depression help` BMM, see if one of them is catching it.

**Fight Depression**
* BMM: 
  * Spending very little. Doesn't seem to be doing much harm; look at it long term, if it's overall spending a lot per conversion, shut off low-performing ads. (Start looking from Sept. 19th).
    * Still spending jack shit (Oct. 17th); *examine* with same methods as `self-help`.
* EM:
  * Ditto above. 

**Depression Test** Failed; high cost. Killed until we make an online PHQ9. 

**Depression Therapy**
* EM doing well; added `depression/program` variant and replicated to BMM. (Oct 30)
    * BMM doing badly (Nov 5), catching lots of random stuff that's hard to exclude. Turn off if continues. *check*
   
**CBT** 
* BMM: 
  * Costs a bit high; reduced spend. (Nov. 19th.)
  * `CBT` group - trying out `/depression/program` variants. If they perform better long-term, replace `/CBT` variants. 
* EMM: 
  * Seeing high ad costs, because many days have spend with no return for many groups. Was spending alright after many adjustments, expansions; but CPA not great. Tried just turning off all but one group, which happened to be performing well in the past week, and lowering budget. See how that impacts things. (Nov 19), and raise budget/re-enable things as appropriate. 
     * Nov 25 - has spent pretty much nothing. Turned some shit back on. :) *check*

**UpLift** (Did not check Oct 17)
* BMM
 * Good CTR, but low conversion. Users looking for sign-ups? Trying to add better ads, but don't know if that's a good way to address it. *check*
 * Added testimonial, explicit price ads, and different url's. Oct 10. *check*
* EMM
 * Added `UpLift for Depression` campaign; BMM too. Oct 10 *check* 
 * Added new ad variants; *check*

**Mood Journal** (checked Oct 10)
* BMM: 
  * Responsive search ad the only one that's spending. Oct 10. 
  * Added a couple titles to responsive ad; added testimonial, /depression/program variants. Oct. 10. *Check*
      * Other ads spent a little; responsive ad still most successful. Added two new variants (testimonial, `depression/program`); choose one that performs the best. (Oct 17)
* If anything's succesful here, ad to EM. *Do*

**Others** - Not yet optimized really. Go through.

**Anxiety**
* EM:
  * Doing well. Added `/anxiety/program` variant; reproduce if successful. Increased the budget a bit.
  * After a bit, start breaking out campaigns. 
    * Got higher; reduced budget a bit Nov 5th. *check*, reduce again if necessary. 
      * Got higher; reduced again. Seems to be converting to purchases poorly; may stop entirely. (Nov 19)
        * Reduced budget further. `anxiety/program` variant the only one that's spending...reproduced for testimonial ad. (Nov 25)
* BM:
  * Spending really high, but it's early; seems to be getting better. Most matches are random one-time things. I excluded a bunch, but may need to exclude some broader words. I lowered the budget a lot. Oct 30.
    * Doing much better with CPA, but spend much lower. Good, leave. 




## To try:
*Next*
* add `android uplift app` and `ios uplift app` to relevant campaign. 
* Create "coping" campaign, if still top un-broken out keyword. 
* Try `android depression app`, `ios depression app` campaigns, or groups within a campaign
* "How to X depression naturally" (or just `depression naturally`). 
* Look at testing out other extensions; potentially customizing to match ads.
* Start a "depressed politics" campaign? maybe with real small budget. 

* Consider editing SEO for organic search to include best copy from ads. 

*More*
* Look at Google Guy's advice, think through application

* Check out Google Trends, apply

* break out cognitive behavioral therapy from cbt?

* Look at trying east-us specific campaign? Locationally specific? 
* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`
* Try customizing extensions to match ads for better relevance scores. 
* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
	* Expand on this - try deep-linking at some point; ask Danielle how possible it is. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
* `How to`...`depression naturally` campaign. (Check out `Beat depression` for example search terms.)




# Q's for Ashley
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.  


# Conclusions (some tentative)


## FB
* Instagram ads seem to have higher cost-per-onboard-end, but lower per sign-up. Yay. (July '19, preliminary) (Aug 27 - but this seems to be dropping; prob necessary to keep creative varied.)
* Sign-up audience is slightly underperforming onboard-end audience...but it might be worth it to have a different audience to aim at, to increase spend. (July '19, preliminary - will sign-ups improve after I winnow the ads?)
