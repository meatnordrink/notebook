# Ads


## Questions for Ashley: 
### FB:
* What is the best strategy for introducing a new ad variation? In existing group, as own group? How about totally new creative? (Should I a/b, if I still can?)
* I've been hesitant to turn off ads which are performing less well, but still okay, within a group, for fear that, when the currently more successful ad has to spend more of the budget, it's performance will decline as well; and as the algorithm may be adapting the ad for slightly different groups, it will actually result in reduced spend overall. Is this correct? What's the best way to respond to an ad that's performing particularly well within a FB ad set?  
### GA: 

# FB

### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25
* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 
* Aug 2019: Instagram Feed Ads bombed.
* Desktop only - July 2019. Failed badly. Could try with more targeted creative/to specific audiences. 
* "Download" CTA doesn't seem to do as well as 'learn more' or 'sign up'.

### Testing

* *IG stories:*
  * Switching from `signed-up` audience to `onboard-end` seems to have been good; costs have gone down to around $2, Oct 1-9th. 
  * Other two ad groups not spending; set a limit of $10 (of $15) on main ad group; check and see 1) if other ads spend a bit now, and 2) what their CPA is. 
    * Didn't work; still didn't really spend. `Old Sept pic` campaign spent a little, but not much and high CPA. Response: Added `woman looking down` ad from `evidence` group to `IG Stories` group (Oct 16th). See if that spends; add a full-image version. **do**, **check**

* *Retargeting:* 
 * `signed-up`: Confirmed that it's performing much worse than `onboard end` retargeting audience. Removed all but one fern ad, added new creative with Sept. woman. remove fern if still performing poorly; or lower budget for entire campaign if all performing poorly.
    * New ads don't seem to have been approved?? Tried to re-publish, Oct. 16th. **check**
 * `clicked` : shifted most of budget to new creative.
   * New creative kicking old's butt. Result: Disabled all flower ads, left fern (best performing) at even lower budget; increased new creative's budget to $15. **check**  

* *Onboard-End:* 
 * Increased spend to $50 on Oct. 4th, did well. Leave for a minute, then increase next week, once effects from new onboard and coach paywall removal are felt; also maybe wait until/if weekly revenue/metrics look better. If they don't, consider reducing spend.  **do**
 * On both onboard-end and signed-up, `single-flower` ads in the evidence-focus campaigns seem to have remained on ferns. I changed it Oct 9th; presumably it won't hurt anything (spend was low for both), but **check**.

* *Signed-up:*
 * Removing old ad group seems to have been fine; costs have remained well below $2 (1.66, Oct 4-9th), and spend still looks good. Look at increasing spend slightly, on same terms as above. **do**

### To check/Do

* For retargeting: Think on, come up with some ideas for best content to serve to retargeting audiences. Run a/b's, perhaps. 

* Think on/discuss best way of adding new creative. Keep budget optimization? Split budgets? 

* REST OF ASHLEYS REC'S: Carousel, regional (also, try to get Google to whitelist us for audiences.)

* See if woman w phone in onboard end continues to heavily outperform other creative. if so....how to respond? Ask Ashley. (Should the algorithm just automatically adjust for that? If it isn't, does it mean it's already getting all the low-cost conversions it can with it? See Q above.)

* Next - try putting IG stories creative in FB feed ads;they had low costs there. (cross competition; same audience..?) (maybe just the images...?)

* Test IG ads targeted solely at men (perhaps in a certain region, to go with regional campaign; and exclude from other campaigns.)

* Look through; if ads consistently run badly on weekends, turn off then. 

### Next
* Launch retarget for IG
* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.) -- IN PROGRESS
* Vary text in creative. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try dynamic creative again.

* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a carousel; or static text with pics of diverse people cylcing through. Try running it on Instagram. 
* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)
* Try busting out most successful ads into own campaigns --(Why, again? Maybe check on Search Focused.pdf)

* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.

* Consider setting the target of the retargeting-purchases campaign as pageviews. 



# Google

## Tested
* Responsive ads - not great so far. Not horrible, but worse than expanded text. Tried in Depression BMM;Depression General, and Mood Journal EM & BMM;Mood Tracker. In the latter, increased spend, but at very high CPR.
    - but, seem to be working in CBT campaigns??
### Keywords Tested: 
* Free Mood Tracking (No spend as of Aug 2019)
* (Neg) `+CBT +Self +Online` - spent nothing.


### General musings: 
* Responsive ads seem to be useful for campaigns that aren't spending, but to perform poorly (cost more) on campaigns that are already doing alright. 

## In Progress: 


**NEXT** - Stop campaigns that aren't spending much, but have high CPA?
               - **Try creating Responsive ads for them first, monitor**
         - Anxiety campaign, post-partum depression campaigns?
         - check out if extensions are changeable
         - `Dep EMM: Overcome Dep`, add some ads. Diff link, explicit price, evidence-based (same set as in `Dep EMM: Dep gen`) 
         - Go to `Dep BMM` campaign, look at any other campaigns with matches; if "how" etc's, add how to exact match, exclude from broad. 
         - Maybe take a break from breaking out campaigns for a bit, check other things; entirely new campaigns, perhaps. Call to try to get whitelisted...

## To check on: 

* See above. 

* Added "how to not be depressed" campaigns; **check on**

* Check how exact-match group's spend look after Oct 1st; increase if it's spending close to $20. 

* (Sep 9) Added explicit price ad variant to `depression BMM; depression general`. ***Check***
   - Explicit cost ad seems to be doing well. Copied to: 
     * `depression EMM: depression general`
	 * `CBT BMM: all groups` (customized)
* Added Responsive ads to CBT EMM campaign, both ad groups. 
       - Not doing as well in `depression EMM: dep gen`, but okay. Not much in `CBT BMM`, but a little; seems worthwhile, as any uptick in that campaign is hard to come by. 


### Depression General Campaign

**Get out of depression**:
* (Check EMM; doing better than BMM.) Looks like `depression/program` does better than `get_out_of/depression`. Changed several to this (Sept 18). If this pattern continues, try a/b'ing rational (rather than relevance-focussed) url's on other, large campaigns (where they aren't).
* BMM: 
  * Based on `depression/program` beating `get_out_of/depression` with "How to get out of depression" ad, duplicated next-best peforming ad, "You can get out of depression" with `/depression/program`. (Oct 9) *check* - if `/depression/program` wins, duplicate for all ads, delete `get_out_of` ads, and a/b on other groups. 
* EMM: 
  * Here, `depression/program` seems to be peforming very well, but `get_out_of` are not performing badly, so I left them in. A mix of both might be wise. 

**Depression Help**: 
  * BMM: 
    * Try breaking out a campaign for `how to help {x} with depression`
  * EMM: 
    * Testimonial ad did well in BMM, added to EM (Oct 9). *check*
    * *Next* Add explicit price ad (to BMM as well).

**Depression self-help**: 
* EM: 
  * Added `self-help` negative keyword to `depression help BMM`; see if performance improves. (9/18)
    * Didn't help much; maybe a little. Still not really spending. But, hadn't added to `depression help EM`; did. (Oct 9) *check*
  * Added two new variants (testimonial, /depression/program), Oct. 9. *check*

*(Stopped here on Oct 9th)*
**Fight Depression**
* Lots of ad variants. Check out.
   
**CBT BMM: All groups**
* Added explicit price ad. 
* Consider turning off responsive search ad on `CBT` group. Left on for now, as it's increasing spend for the account, I think...but it's costing significantly more. 



* Re: above - maybe just try a campaign for `how to ... depression` [fight cope get rid not be snap out pull yourself out]

* `Depression Test`/`Depression Therapy` - new campaigns requested by Eddie. `Test` spending low with high cost; `therapy` currently not spending. If they don't improve, kill. If they start doing better, create BMM campaigns to match. *check*

## To try:
* Create "coping" campaign, if still top un-broken out keyword. 

* Look at Google Guy's advice, think through application

* Check out Google Trends, apply

* natural depression campaign

* depression therapy campaign

* break out cognitive behavioral therapy from cbt?

* Look at trying east-us specific campaign? Locationally specific? 
* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`
* Try customizing extensions to match ads for better relevance scores. 
* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
	* Expand on this - try deep-linking at some point; ask Danielle how possible it is. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
* `How to`...`depression naturally` campaign. (Check out `Beat depression` for example search terms.)




# Q's for Ashley
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.  


# Conclusions (some tentative)


## FB
* Instagram ads seem to have higher cost-per-onboard-end, but lower per sign-up. Yay. (July '19, preliminary) (Aug 27 - but this seems to be dropping; prob necessary to keep creative varied.)
* Sign-up audience is slightly underperforming onboard-end audience...but it might be worth it to have a different audience to aim at, to increase spend. (July '19, preliminary - will sign-ups improve after I winnow the ads?)
