# Ads
> Since Mar 3 2020 switch to native app

# FB
## To do: 
* Try retargeting people who downloaded but did not purchase.
* Try ads featuring image of app; try Rewards. 
* Ads that send people to landing page vs straight to app. 

# Google
* First, get to frigging spend. It may be that I need to dive into the Firebase setup.
* Add other ad groups from "Depression General"
* Add a "Depression + Anxiety" group; exclude that from other searches. 
* Ads that send people to landing page vs straight to app. 
* Check out the bid simulator; check out which spend level (according to Google) we'd get the most profit.

# Apple Search
* Expand depending on results.
* Consider an EM campaign. 
* Try ads featuring other screens of app; Rewards. 
* Consider overhauling and just running advanced BM and EM.
