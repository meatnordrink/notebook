**Leave spend stable for a bit; try to make tweaks to increase purchases/$ (leave stable to increase visibility on this)** (But, covid...might want to reduce, *then* leave stable.)

## To do: 

* **To-do** - Consider revisiting "New April Creative" group and trying a few more of them in an active campaign. 

* Try retargeting people who downloaded but did not purchase.
* Try ads featuring image of app; try Rewards. 
* Ads that send people to landing page vs straight to app. 
    * Not entirely sure how to a/b this, as I can't set it on a per-ad level. I wonder if I can create an audience out of people who have clicked on one campaign, and then exclude them from the other campaign....
* Also try sending people to web onboard vs landing page. 

* Try multiple-headlines/descriptions variant. If it does well, make that default. 
* Depending on how Worldwide audience does, try English-speaking countries only audience.
* *Once some of the April 15 experiments conclude, try introducing anxiety ads*

## Recent Takeaways
* CTA - "Install now" seems to do much better than "Download now"

## IG
**To-do**
* Try "learn more" button variations after winnowing new creative.
* Whichever image of this April group does best (even if bad), try with swapped description and title text.
* Try adding more primary text options to an ad variant: Use testimonial, price variants. 
* If the guy ad groups don't spend, try as separate campaign so I can control spend.

# Google
**App Installs**
* (Apr 21) Paused anxiety, images; poor spend. Try anxiety as separate campaign with limited budget. (Maybe images as well.) 
**Anxiety Search**
* Go into Anxiety BMM and break out successful keywords ("How to get rid of anxiety")
* In Anxiety EM:
    * If Ad 393355864264 continues to suck (high CTR, low conversion rate), pause it.
**Depression Search**
* Check on quarantine ads. Make sure spend shifted to exact match; check which ads are doing well and adjust based on that. 


* Create ad group for `ios depression app` `iphone depression app`.
* Go into exact match campaign, figure out why spend is lower, cost higher than broad.



* Add a "Depression + Anxiety" group; exclude that from other searches. 
* Ads that send people to landing page vs straight to app. 
* Check out the bid simulator; check out which spend level (according to Google) we'd get the most profit.

# Apple Search
* **Do** - kill existing Advanced campaign, start a new one at roughly $5/day spend, *OR*:
* A/B just Basic vs just Advanced campaign. 

* Expand depending on results.
* Consider an EM campaign. 
* Try ads featuring other screens of app; Rewards. 
* Consider overhauling and just running advanced BM and EM.
