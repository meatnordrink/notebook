(Re-organize this such that to-dos are at top; questions/future at bottom.)

## Questions for Ashley: 
### FB:
* What is the best strategy for introducing a new ad variation? In existing group, as own group? How about totally new creative? (Should I a/b, if I still can?)
* I've been hesitant to turn off ads which are performing less well, but still okay, within a group, for fear that, when the currently more successful ad has to spend more of the budget, it's performance will decline as well; and as the algorithm may be adapting the ad for slightly different groups, it will actually result in reduced spend overall. Is this correct? What's the best way to respond to an ad that's performing particularly well within a FB ad set?  
* RE: Regional targeting - the ideas is I'm supposed to exclude NY targeting from my other campaigns, yeah, so I'm not competing against myself? But is it a good idea to turn off advertising in a large market, with a campaign with lots of accumulated learning, in favor of a campaign with no learning, and with a very different pitch? (The changes are not small.) 
* **Discuss how to best divide ads among campaign/group.**
### GA: 
* Google Regional Targeting: Does this make any sense? No one searches "depression in New York", really. Seasonal Depression might be regionally specific; but won't searching be self-selecting? (Like, if someone searches it, I don't really care where they are; not many people in areas that don't have seasonal changes are going to do the search.) So I'm kinda' assuming this doesn't apply to us.
* I'm using Target CPA on Google Ads, which supposedly uses "smart bidding." Will this take locations most likely to convert into account automatically, or is geo-targeting still necessary?


# Things to do/clarify in general
* Get crystal clear on at what levels ads compete with each other - https://uhurunetwork.com/audience-overlap-facebook-marketing-mistake/
* Do a careful a/b for wording of each variant
* "" CTA
* But, be open to the possibility that different wording/cta appeal to different people.

# FB

***Notes of the moment:*** 
* Try dialect ads?
*  
* Try a broader audience; one article mentioned that FB has recently shifted favor to broadly-targeted campaigns. 


### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25

*Turned everything off just before Christmas 2019; starting again.*

### Testing

**Testing how to best insert ads into new campaigns. Jan 24 started Hemlocks, ad, inserted into existing ad groups.**
  * Jan 30 - spending in some, not in others. Tried splitting into separate ad group in one. Could be interesting to try as own campaign, but...overlap. 

**Give Jan 30 changes a minute, then - Experiment with moving things into a less intra-competitive campaign structure. Move all ads into same ad group within a single campaign; monitor how that affects performance. If positive, repeat for other campaigns. Consider making campaigns with different audiences all ad groups within a single campaign; however, at that point, you lose individual budget control.**

* *IG stories:*
  * (Dec 31st) One ad from Sept. creative doing well. Turned off other (which entails higher budget for remaining ad), and linked to IG account. Cost/acquistion was .89. See how that does; if it continues to do similarly/better, try some variations. 
    * Jan 13th - still about .90/ad target; increased budget to $3.00. 
      * Jan 24th - Introduced winterBridge, Hemlocks creative. **Todo** - after eliminating poor performing, try variants with "app" in wording. If all poor performing, try introducing as separate ad group; or separate campaign. 
        * Jan 30th - leave for a bit, see if others start spending. If not, can try turning off older womanWPhone ad.
* *Retargeting:* 
 * Turned off one of these groups...examine more carefully/turn up significantly one week, see if impact. (Jan 13)
* *Onboard-End:* 
 * For both this and signed-up, right now just turning off ads that have high spend/groups if all ads are high. If it seems like I'm narrowing too much, either lower budget, re-enable, or introduce new creative. (Jan 13)
* *Signed-up:*
  * Increased minimum spend on new-year's ad group to $3/day (was spending about $2, learning limited...). Once more data, shut off a couple of the ads. ( Jan 13 )

### To check/Do

* Need to clarity all through funnel for retargeting and instagram; should we abandon these? They have higher costs early on, but maybe they do better later in the funnel?

* Think on maybe an Oceania campaign? Or, check what currencies we're getting paid in, and try a campaign targeting whatever's behind USD?

* For retargeting: Think on, come up with some ideas for best content to serve to retargeting audiences. Run a/b's, perhaps. 

* Carousel/multiple image ads

* Get Google to whitelist us for Google custom audiences

* Test IG ads targeted solely at men. Custom creative, obviously. 

* Look through; if ads consistently run badly on weekends, turn off then. 

* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.

* "Telling a story" about depression ad. w pic, carousel. 

* Try small campaign targeting life events. 

* Bing campaign (have existing account, could revive)

### Next


# Google

Turned everything off on 16th; turned back on on 19th, but only Dep Gen BMM/EM. Leave as-is for a bit; when/if we wish to expand, potentially at higher cost, look at enabling CBT campaigns. 

### Depression General Campaign

Turned down both campaigns on Jan 10th, I believe; also fixed onboard issue, which may help things.

* **How to Get Out of Depression** - EM. This is the highest-spend group for the last 14 days (Jan 13); "how to" added in increases cost. Keep an eye on; if remains same (or just when you get the chance) - break out "how to ..." from just "get out of..."; if the how-to continues to perform poorly with tailored creative, kill. 


## To try:
*Next*

* Look at testing out other extensions; potentially customizing to match ads.
* Start a "depressed politics" campaign? maybe with real small budget. 

* Consider editing SEO for organic search to include best copy from ads. 

*More*
* Look at Google Guy's advice, think through application

* Check out Google Trends, apply

* break out cognitive behavioral therapy from cbt?

* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`

* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
	* Expand on this - try deep-linking at some point; ask Danielle how possible it is. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
* `How to`...`depression naturally` campaign. (Check out `Beat depression` for example search terms.)




# Q's for Ashley
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.
