# Ads
> Since Mar 3 2020 switch to native app

**Leave spend stable for a bit; try to make tweaks to increase purchases/$ (leave stable to increase visibility on this)** (But, covid...might want to reduce, *then* leave stable.)

**Do an analysis of purchasers by country; correlate that to ad spend by country. Adjust as appropriate based on which countries are most profitable.** 

# FB
## To do: 

**When possible, make a lookalike audience based on purchasers.**
**When possible, make a campaign that optimizes for purchases (once we have min 50/month...but prob 50/week.)**

* **To-do** 
    * New creative May 4, 11. Spend has been increasing; check around the 16th or so, and whatever's not spending/high, turn off and throw in others from April round.  

- Try a video ad. (Just moving text, transitions.)


* Try ads featuring image of app; try Rewards. 
* Ads that send people to landing page vs straight to app. 
    * Not entirely sure how to a/b this, as I can't set it on a per-ad level. I wonder if I can create an audience out of people who have clicked on one campaign, and then exclude them from the other campaign....
* Also try sending people to web onboard vs landing page. 

* Try multiple-headlines/descriptions variant. If it does well, make that default. 
* *Once some of the April 15 experiments conclude, try introducing anxiety ads*

## Recent Takeaways
* CTA - "Install now" seems to do much better than "Download now"

## IG
**To-do**
* *May 4th* - limited men campaign to $1.50 spend. Check in a few days, potentially limit further.
* If you can get this spending at a reasonable CPR, consider moving from "bid cap" to "lowest cost."

# Google
**App Installs**
* Expanded countries targeted (May 1). If CPR increases, reverse. 
* *To do* - try switching from "in or interested in" to "living in or regularly in" targeted locations for app install ads. Keep budget steady. If it doesn't increase costs, probably a good idea. (As people in our locations, rather than interested in, are more likely to have the money to purchase.)
* *To do* - depending on by-country results of app install campaigns, try separating US, other countries into two campaigns. (Could do the same for FB, actually.
)
* May 12th - expanded search campaigns to all countries. 

**Anxiety Search**
* Go into Anxiety BMM and break out successful keywords ("How to get rid of anxiety")
* In Anxiety EM:
    * If Ad 393355864264 continues to suck (high CTR, low conversion rate), pause it.
**Depression Search**
* *Notes, May 4* 
    * the Fight Depression ad group was using Beat Depression in ads. May account for higher ad spend? Fixed, keep an eye on. (Hopefully that and adding negative keywords to Fight Depression will have a positive effect on its CPR.)
    * Increased Anxiety BMM campaign. If CPR increases, try disabling explicit cost ad variant.  


* Create ad group for `ios depression app` `iphone depression app`.

* Add a "Depression + Anxiety" group; exclude that from other searches. 
* Ads that send people to landing page vs straight to app. 
* Check out the bid simulator; check out which spend level (according to Google) we'd get the most profit.

# Apple Search
* **Do** - kill existing Advanced campaign, start a new one at roughly $5/day spend, *OR*:
* A/B just Basic vs just Advanced campaign. 

* Expand depending on results.
* Consider an EM campaign. 
* Try ads featuring other screens of app; Rewards. 
* Consider overhauling and just running advanced BM and EM.
