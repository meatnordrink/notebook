# Ads

## Questions for Ashley: 
### FB:
* What is the best strategy for introducing a new ad variation? In existing group, as own group? How about totally new creative? (Should I a/b, if I still can?)
* I've been hesitant to turn off ads which are performing less well, but still okay, within a group, for fear that, when the currently more successful ad has to spend more of the budget, it's performance will decline as well; and as the algorithm may be adapting the ad for slightly different groups, it will actually result in reduced spend overall. Is this correct? What's the best way to respond to an ad that's performing particularly well within a FB ad set?  
* RE: Regional targeting - the ideas is I'm supposed to exclude NY targeting from my other campaigns, yeah, so I'm not competing against myself? But is it a good idea to turn off advertising in a large market, with a campaign with lots of accumulated learning, in favor of a campaign with no learning, and with a very different pitch? (The changes are not small.) 
### GA: 
* Google Regional Targeting: Does this make any sense? No one searches "depression in New York", really. Seasonal Depression might be regionally specific; but won't searching be self-selecting? (Like, if someone searches it, I don't really care where they are; not many people in areas that don't have seasonal changes are going to do the search.) So I'm kinda' assuming this doesn't apply to us.
* I'm using Target CPA on Google Ads, which supposedly uses "smart bidding." Will this take locations most likely to convert into account automatically, or is geo-targeting still necessary?


# FB

***Notes of the moment:*** 
* Try dialect ads?
*  
* Try a broader audience; one article mentioned that FB has recently shifted favor to broadly-targeted campaigns. 


### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25

*Turned everything off just before Christmas 2019; starting again.*

### Testing

* *IG stories:*

* *Retargeting:* 

* *Onboard-End:* 

* *Signed-up:*

* *Regionally Targeted*
  Performing badly after Christmas; turned off (Dec 31)
* *Anxiety*
  Did well, but users from this pathway converted to purchase very poorly; turned off ~ Dec 16. 

### To check/Do

* Need to clarity all through funnel for retargeting and instagram; should we abandon these? They have higher costs early on, but maybe they do better later in the funnel?

* Think on maybe an Oceania campaign? Or, check what currencies we're getting paid in, and try a campaign targeting whatever's behind USD?

* For retargeting: Think on, come up with some ideas for best content to serve to retargeting audiences. Run a/b's, perhaps. 

* Carousel/multiple image ads

* Get Google to whitelist us for Google custom audiences

* Test IG ads targeted solely at men. Custom creative, obviously. 

* Look through; if ads consistently run badly on weekends, turn off then. 

* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.

* "Telling a story" about depression ad. w pic, carousel. 

* Try small campaign targeting life events. 

* Bing campaign (have existing account, could revive)

### Next


# Google (Did not clean this up on Dec 2019 archive; clean next time I go through.)

Turned everything off on 16th; turned back on on 19th, but only Dep Gen BMM/EM. Leave as-is for a bit; when/if we wish to expand, potentially at higher cost, look at enabling CBT campaigns. 

### Depression General Campaign (Oct 17th last check)

**How to cope with depression**
* Baseline: As part of `depression general BMM`, this keyword had 10 conversions, at a cost of $1.62, over 3 months (Aug-Oct). *check* to see if breaking it out into an exact-match campaign improves upon this.
* Oct 30 start, from `dep gen`.

**How to beat depression**
* Started Oct 30; broke out from `beat depression`. *check*

**How to fight depression**
* Broke out from `fight depression` and `depression general`, Oct 30. *check*

**Get out of depression**:
* (Check EMM; doing better than BMM.) Looks like `depression/program` does better than `get_out_of/depression`. Changed several to this (Sept 18). If this pattern continues, try a/b'ing rational (rather than relevance-focussed) url's on other, large campaigns (where they aren't).
* BMM: 
  * `/depression/program` ads were all performing better than `get_out_of/depression` ads, so I disabled all but one, which was spending low, but good CPA. 
* EMM: 
  * Same as above, but disabled all. CPA was high for all but the top ad; should I shut down the higher-performing ads, or will they just spend less if I do? (Good Q for Ashley.) 
  * EMM are coming in with a higher CPA than BMM; why? Check what search terms BMM is getting, make sure ads are the same. (Perhaps most likely: Could be just that EMM has more conversions due to acquirable higher bids; had 79 conversions vs 39.) (Oct 17th) 
  * *Next* - Add explicit price variant to both EM and BMM

**Depression Help**: 
  * BMM: 
    * Try breaking out a campaign for `how to help {x} with depression`
  * EMM: 
    * Testimonial ad did well in BMM, added to EM (Oct 9). *check*
      * Testimonial add did well in both BMM and EM; added explicit price ad (to BMM as well), Oct. 17th. *check*

**Depression self-help**: 
* EM: 
  * Still not spending; nothing seems to have helped yet. 
  * Added new testimonial, another `/depression/program` variant. (Oct. 17th) *check*
  * If still not spending, look again at `depression general`, `depression help` BMM, see if one of them is catching it.

**Fight Depression**
* BMM: 
  * Spending very little. Doesn't seem to be doing much harm; look at it long term, if it's overall spending a lot per conversion, shut off low-performing ads. (Start looking from Sept. 19th).
    * Still spending jack shit (Oct. 17th); *examine* with same methods as `self-help`.
* EM:
  * Ditto above. 

**Depression Test** Failed; high cost. Killed until we make an online PHQ9. 

**Depression Therapy**
* EM doing well; added `depression/program` variant and replicated to BMM. (Oct 30)
    * BMM doing badly (Nov 5), catching lots of random stuff that's hard to exclude. Turn off if continues. *check*
   
**CBT** 
* BMM: 
  * Costs a bit high; reduced spend. (Nov. 19th.)
  * `CBT` group - trying out `/depression/program` variants. If they perform better long-term, replace `/CBT` variants. 
* EMM: 
  * Seeing high ad costs, because many days have spend with no return for many groups. Was spending alright after many adjustments, expansions; but CPA not great. Tried just turning off all but one group, which happened to be performing well in the past week, and lowering budget. See how that impacts things. (Nov 19), and raise budget/re-enable things as appropriate. 
     * Nov 25 - has spent pretty much nothing. Turned some shit back on. :) *check*

**UpLift** (Did not check Oct 17)
* BMM
 * Good CTR, but low conversion. Users looking for sign-ups? Trying to add better ads, but don't know if that's a good way to address it. *check*
 * Added testimonial, explicit price ads, and different url's. Oct 10. *check*
* EMM
 * Added `UpLift for Depression` campaign; BMM too. Oct 10 *check* 
 * Added new ad variants; *check*

**Mood Journal** (checked Oct 10)
* BMM: 
  * Responsive search ad the only one that's spending. Oct 10. 
  * Added a couple titles to responsive ad; added testimonial, /depression/program variants. Oct. 10. *Check*
      * Other ads spent a little; responsive ad still most successful. Added two new variants (testimonial, `depression/program`); choose one that performs the best. (Oct 17)
* If anything's succesful here, ad to EM. *Do*

**Others** - Not yet optimized really. Go through.

**Anxiety**
* EM:
  * Doing well. Added `/anxiety/program` variant; reproduce if successful. Increased the budget a bit.
  * After a bit, start breaking out campaigns. 
    * Got higher; reduced budget a bit Nov 5th. *check*, reduce again if necessary. 
      * Got higher; reduced again. Seems to be converting to purchases poorly; may stop entirely. (Nov 19)
        * Reduced budget further. `anxiety/program` variant the only one that's spending...reproduced for testimonial ad. (Nov 25)
* BM:
  * Spending really high, but it's early; seems to be getting better. Most matches are random one-time things. I excluded a bunch, but may need to exclude some broader words. I lowered the budget a lot. Oct 30.
    * Doing much better with CPA, but spend much lower. Good, leave. 




## To try:
*Next*

* Look at testing out other extensions; potentially customizing to match ads.
* Start a "depressed politics" campaign? maybe with real small budget. 

* Consider editing SEO for organic search to include best copy from ads. 

*More*
* Look at Google Guy's advice, think through application

* Check out Google Trends, apply

* break out cognitive behavioral therapy from cbt?

* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`

* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
	* Expand on this - try deep-linking at some point; ask Danielle how possible it is. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
* `How to`...`depression naturally` campaign. (Check out `Beat depression` for example search terms.)




# Q's for Ashley
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.
