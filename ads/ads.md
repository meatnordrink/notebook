# Ads


## Questions for Ashley: 
### FB:
* What is the best strategy for introducing a new ad variation? In existing group, as own group? How about totally new creative? (Should I a/b, if I still can?)
* I've been hesitant to turn off ads which are performing less well, but still okay, within a group, for fear that, when the currently more successful ad has to spend more of the budget, it's performance will decline as well; and as the algorithm may be adapting the ad for slightly different groups, it will actually result in reduced spend overall. Is this correct? What's the best way to respond to an ad that's performing particularly well within a FB ad set?  
### GA: 

# FB

### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25
* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 
* Aug 2019: Instagram Feed Ads bombed.
* Desktop only - July 2019. Failed badly. Could try with more targeted creative/to specific audiences. 
* "Download" CTA doesn't seem to do as well as 'learn more' or 'sign up'.

### Testing

* *IG stories:*
  * Switching from `signed-up` audience to `onboard-end` seems to have been good; costs have gone down to around $2, Oct 1-9th. 
  * Other two ad groups not spending; set a limit of $10 (of $15) on main ad group; check and see 1) if other ads spend a bit now, and 2) what their CPA is. 
    * Didn't work; still didn't really spend. `Old Sept pic` campaign spent a little, but not much and high CPA. Response: Added `woman looking down` ad from `evidence` group to `IG Stories` group (Oct 16th). See if that spends; add a full-image version. 
       * (Oct 24) Didn't. Stopped. If other campaigns don't spend, force an a/b test (and re-try these).
       * (Oct 24) Also, turned off campaign budget optimization, so that I can manually allocate amongst ad groups. (Might be worth re-trying some of those old ad groups under this system.)
  * (Oct 24) Created new IG stories creative. **check** variations. **do** -> select most successful, and try variations in: 
      * background color
      * text creative
      * font style/size
      Once this is done, try with similar but different photos in future months.


* *Retargeting:* 
 * `signed-up`: Confirmed that it's performing much worse than `onboard end` retargeting audience. Removed all but one fern ad, added new creative with Sept. woman. remove fern if still performing poorly; or lower budget for entire campaign if all performing poorly.
    * New ads don't seem to have been approved?? Tried to re-publish, Oct. 16th; lowered budget to $3 for now.
        * Sucking hard, mostly; fern ad doing alright. But haven't spent much. 
            * Tried new tack; tried optimizing for link clicks. CPC and CPLC are actually good, the best of any; my thought is that it may be that, because people have already signed up, somehow the conversions aren't firing...maybe the go to the "already signed up?" link? That would actually make sense. 
               * Depending on how this goes, **check**
                   * Try another campaign aiming at this audience with a conversion event firing on the "already signed up?" link on the page. 

 * `clicked` : shifted most of budget to new creative.
   * New creative kicking old's butt. Result: Disabled all flower ads, left fern (best performing) at even lower budget; increased new creative's budget to $15. (Oct 16)
      * Oct 24 - One fern left in old campaign doing great; increased budget $2 to $3. Continue to increase slowly. **check**
      * Oct 24 - Created new ad group with explicit cost. If it doesn't bomb, a/b (actual split test) with a different headline. **check**


* *Onboard-End:* 
 * Added an explicit-cost + evidence group, Oct 24th. **check** If it does well, reproduce for signed-up audience.
 * After see the results from adding explicit-cost ad, increase budget slightly.**do** (Oct 24)

* *Signed-up:*
 * Removing old ad group seems to have been fine; costs have remained well below $2 (1.66, Oct 4-9th), and spend still looks good. Look at increasing spend slightly, on same terms as above. 
    * Evidence creative seems to be kicking ass; but campaign budget optimization is on, so it could just be that it's getting aimed at all the cheap conversions. Increased budget a touch, as planned; if non-evidence creative continues to have higher CPA, turn off and see if other costs increase. **check** **do** (Oct 24)

* *Regionally Targeted*
  * Copy ideas: 
      - "There's more than one way to prepare for winter" "This isn't the only way to prepare for winter"... something like that. Image of some kind of winter prep. 
      - "It's important to prepare for winter." Squirrel image. "Take care of your mind this winter with UpLift, the first depression app of its kind."
      - Try positive first, then try negative. 
      - Positive: "Prepare yourself to make the most of this winter."
      - Negative: "Don't let seasonal depression prevent you from making the most of winter. 
      - Hybrid: Negative copy, positive image (winter fun in NY.)
      - See if I can target rural vs city; adjust images appropriately. (Looks like I can; perhaps, for first campaign, try targeting city; then try rural.)

* *Anxiety*
  * Started Oct 28. 

### To check/Do

* Think on maybe an Oceania campaign? Or, check what currencies we're getting paid in, and try a campaign targeting whatever's behind USD?

* For retargeting: Think on, come up with some ideas for best content to serve to retargeting audiences. Run a/b's, perhaps. 

* Think on/discuss best way of adding new creative. Keep budget optimization? Split budgets? 

* REST OF ASHLEYS REC'S: Carousel, regional (also, try to get Google to whitelist us for audiences.)

* See if woman w phone in onboard end continues to heavily outperform other creative. if so....how to respond? Ask Ashley. (Should the algorithm just automatically adjust for that? If it isn't, does it mean it's already getting all the low-cost conversions it can with it? See Q above.)

* Next - try putting IG stories creative in FB feed ads;they had low costs there. (cross competition; same audience..?) (maybe just the images...?)

* Test IG ads targeted solely at men (perhaps in a certain region, to go with regional campaign; and exclude from other campaigns.)

* Look through; if ads consistently run badly on weekends, turn off then. 

### Next
* Launch retarget for IG
* Try targeting life events
* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.) -- IN PROGRESS
* Vary text in creative. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try dynamic creative again.

* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a carousel; or static text with pics of diverse people cylcing through. Try running it on Instagram. 
* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)
* Try busting out most successful ads into own campaigns --(Why, again? Maybe check on Search Focused.pdf)

* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.

* Consider setting the target of the retargeting-purchases campaign as pageviews. 



# Google

## Tested
* Responsive ads - not great so far. Not horrible, but worse than expanded text. Tried in Depression BMM;Depression General, and Mood Journal EM & BMM;Mood Tracker. In the latter, increased spend, but at very high CPR.
    - but, seem to be working in CBT campaigns??
### Keywords Tested: 
* Free Mood Tracking (No spend as of Aug 2019)
* (Neg) `+CBT +Self +Online` - spent nothing.


### General musings: 
* Responsive ads seem to be useful for campaigns that aren't spending, but to perform poorly (cost more) on campaigns that are already doing alright. 

## In Progress: 


**NEXT** - Stop campaigns that aren't spending much, but have high CPA?
               - **Try creating Responsive ads for them first, monitor**
         - Anxiety campaign, post-partum depression campaigns?
         - check out if extensions are changeable
         - `Dep EMM: Overcome Dep`, add some ads. Diff link, explicit price, evidence-based (same set as in `Dep EMM: Dep gen`) 
         - Go to `Dep BMM` campaign, look at any other campaigns with matches; if "how" etc's, add how to exact match, exclude from broad. 
         - Maybe take a break from breaking out campaigns for a bit, check other things; entirely new campaigns, perhaps. Call to try to get whitelisted...

## Budget: 

* Spend seems to be pretty solid under $2; added $100 to `Dep Gen BM`, $50 to `" " EM`. Hold steady for the rest of the month; expect a bit of a rise at the end of the month, then dip as the next one starts. 
* *If the increase at the end of the month is severe, lower the ad budget at the end of the month to constrain spend*

### Depression General Campaign (Oct 17th last check)

*Todo Next* 
  * Go through CBT exact, broad, post Nov 1st. CPA was very high; some ads/groups were spending a lot with no results. But, it was the end of the month. Reduced budget Nov 1st; see if pattern holds. If so, disable (such as `CBT App EM`.) But hopefully it was just burning through budget.


**Anxiety**
* Launched Oct. 28. Check and optimize; see what search terms are coming up and refine.

**Get out of depression**:
* (Check EMM; doing better than BMM.) Looks like `depression/program` does better than `get_out_of/depression`. Changed several to this (Sept 18). If this pattern continues, try a/b'ing rational (rather than relevance-focussed) url's on other, large campaigns (where they aren't).
* BMM: 
  * `/depression/program` ads were all performing better than `get_out_of/depression` ads, so I disabled all but one, which was spending low, but good CPA. 
* EMM: 
  * Same as above, but disabled all. CPA was high for all but the top ad; should I shut down the higher-performing ads, or will they just spend less if I do? (Good Q for Ashley.) 
  * EMM are coming in with a higher CPA than BMM; why? Check what search terms BMM is getting, make sure ads are the same. (Perhaps most likely: Could be just that EMM has more conversions due to acquirable higher bids; had 79 conversions vs 39.) (Oct 17th) 
  * *Next* - Add explicit price variant to both EM and BMM

**Depression Help**: 
  * BMM: 
    * Try breaking out a campaign for `how to help {x} with depression`
  * EMM: 
    * Testimonial ad did well in BMM, added to EM (Oct 9). *check*
      * Testimonial add did well in both BMM and EM; added explicit price ad (to BMM as well), Oct. 17th. **check**

**Depression self-help**: 
* EM: 
  * Still not spending; nothing seems to have helped yet. 
  * Added new testimonial, another `/depression/program` variant. (Oct. 17th) *check*
  * If still not spending, look again at `depression general`, `depression help` BMM, see if one of them is catching it.

**Fight Depression**
* BMM: 
  * Spending very little. Doesn't seem to be doing much harm; look at it long term, if it's overall spending a lot per conversion, shut off low-performing ads. (Start looking from Sept. 19th).
    * Still spending jack shit (Oct. 17th); *examine* with same methods as `self-help`.
* EM:
  * Ditto above. 
   
**CBT** (Checked Oct 28)
General: Wondering if this might be where it's gonna be. ? Perhaps better to focus on other avenues, and leave this as a low-spending option, unless I want to try display network stuff, or get custom audiences. (Oct 17th.)
* BMM:
  * Spending up to about $4/day by Oct 1-9; trying to increase. 
    * Oct 28th: $10-$20/day; changes on Oct 17th must have had some effect!
  * `CBT` Group: Added testimonial ad, added explicit price copy to responsive ad, and added 2nd responsive ad with testimonial as option (Oct 10), a/b, go with winner unless both performing well. 
      * W/ testimonial performed well; shut off other. (Oct. 17th)
          * (Oct 28th) Responsive cost very high, so shut off; other ads all doing alright (spending); standard ad still doing best, but left all.
      * Excluded more irrelevant search terms. (Oct 28)     
  * Created `CBT self help` campaign; many ad variants. Oct 10. 
      * Not spending. (Oct 17th)
          * Still not spending; paused. (Oct 28th)
  * `For Depression` group:
    * Added `/program` variation to standard creative. *check*, reproduce if effective. 
  * `app` group:
        * Oct 28th; added `/program` variants for explicit price and testimonial ads; if `/program` continues to perform better than `/app`, switch. *check*
* EMM: 
  * Spending at ~.50/day, Sept. 19-Oct 9. Trying to increase. 
    * Up to $2.00/day, yay! (Oct. 17)
      * Up to about $5/day (Oct 28), yay! 17th changes must have helped. 
  * `App`
    * Seems to be doing well, since Oct 10th (? Really?) creation; added testimonial and explicit price variants. *check*
  * Ditto `CBT self-help` *check*
    * Spent a little, good CPA. (Oct 17)
  * To `CBT for Depression` group, added testimonial, explicit price, /depression/program, responsive ad, disabled high-cost ad variant (no "try free"); Oct. 10.
    * All seem good; added testimonial to the responsive ad, as it's done well elsewhere. (Oct. 17) 
       * Tweaked a little Oct 28. *check* (Responsive not spending now, but that might be because other ads are spending more. I'm fine with it.)
  * Added all the ads to `CBT` group, Oct 10. *check* 
    * Seem fine, though several not spending; added `/depression/program` variant.
       * `depression/program` variant did well; several `CBT/Program` variants not converting; but not spending either, so left. (Can *check* from the 10th/18th, disable if they spend enough to be more than a conversion is worth.)

**UpLift** (Did not check Oct 17)
* BMM
 * Good CTR, but low conversion. Users looking for sign-ups? Trying to add better ads, but don't know if that's a good way to address it. *check*
 * Added testimonial, explicit price ads, and different url's. Oct 10. *check*
* EMM
 * Added `UpLift for Depression` campaign; BMM too. Oct 10 *check* 
 * Added new ad variants; *check*

**Mood Journal** (checked Oct 10)
* BMM: 
  * Responsive search ad the only one that's spending. Oct 10. 
  * Added a couple titles to responsive ad; added testimonial, /depression/program variants. Oct. 10. *Check*
      * Other ads spent a little; responsive ad still most successful. Added two new variants (testimonial, `depression/program`); choose one that performs the best. (Oct 17)
* If anything's succesful here, ad to EM. *Do*

**Others** - Not yet optimized really. Go through. 



* Re: above - maybe just try a campaign for `how to ... depression` [fight cope get rid not be snap out pull yourself out]

* `Depression Test`/`Depression Therapy` - new campaigns requested by Eddie. `Test` spending low with high cost; `therapy` currently not spending. If they don't improve, kill. If they start doing better, create BMM campaigns to match. *check*

## To try:
*Next*
* add `android uplift app` and `ios uplift app` to relevant campaign. 
* Create "coping" campaign, if still top un-broken out keyword. 
* Try `android depression app`, `ios depression app` campaigns, or groups within a campaign
* "How to X depression naturally" (or just `depression naturally`). 
* Look at testing out other extensions; potentially customizing to match ads.

* Consider editing SEO for organic search to include best copy from ads. 

*More*
* Look at Google Guy's advice, think through application

* Check out Google Trends, apply

* break out cognitive behavioral therapy from cbt?

* Look at trying east-us specific campaign? Locationally specific? 
* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`
* Try customizing extensions to match ads for better relevance scores. 
* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
	* Expand on this - try deep-linking at some point; ask Danielle how possible it is. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
* `How to`...`depression naturally` campaign. (Check out `Beat depression` for example search terms.)




# Q's for Ashley
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.  


# Conclusions (some tentative)


## FB
* Instagram ads seem to have higher cost-per-onboard-end, but lower per sign-up. Yay. (July '19, preliminary) (Aug 27 - but this seems to be dropping; prob necessary to keep creative varied.)
* Sign-up audience is slightly underperforming onboard-end audience...but it might be worth it to have a different audience to aim at, to increase spend. (July '19, preliminary - will sign-ups improve after I winnow the ads?)
