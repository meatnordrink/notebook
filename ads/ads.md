# Ads
> Since Mar 3 2020 switch to native app

**Leave spend stable for a bit; try to make tweaks to increase purchases/$ (leave stable to increase visibility on this)** (But, covid...might want to reduce, *then* leave stable.)

# FB
## To do: 
* Consider restarting old campaigns, just send them to the website. (Need to put the pixel on the website, set up a conversion event, if it's not already there.)
* Could consider allowing other platforms. 
* *Reduced daily spend on main campaign from $200 to $150; Mar 23*

* Try app-based lookalike audiences when available.
* Try retargeting people who downloaded but did not purchase.
* Try ads featuring image of app; try Rewards. 
* Ads that send people to landing page vs straight to app. 
    * Not entirely sure how to a/b this, as I can't set it on a per-ad level. I wonder if I can create an audience out of people who have clicked on one campaign, and then exclude them from the other campaign....
* Also try sending people to web onboard vs landing page. 

# Google
* Tweak ad copy to be clear it's for iOS, not Android, to reduce Android clicks.
* Wrap conversion in iOS-only JS. (Maybe algorithm will pick up on this anyway...)
* Create ad group for `ios depression app` `iphone depression app`.
* Try to expand the iOS app install campaign. 
* Go into exact match campaign, figure out why spend is lower, cost higher than broad.


* First, get to frigging spend. It may be that I need to dive into the Firebase setup.
    * No, it was the target CPA (at least, for some of the campaigns.) Spending now (Mar 19), let it spend over the weekend, then **go in and optimize.**
* Add other ad groups from "Depression General"
* Add a "Depression + Anxiety" group; exclude that from other searches. 
* Ads that send people to landing page vs straight to app. 
* Check out the bid simulator; check out which spend level (according to Google) we'd get the most profit.

# Apple Search
* **Do** - kill existing Advanced campaign, start a new one at roughly $5/day spend, *OR*:
* A/B just Basic vs just Advanced campaign. 

* Expand depending on results.
* Consider an EM campaign. 
* Try ads featuring other screens of app; Rewards. 
* Consider overhauling and just running advanced BM and EM.
