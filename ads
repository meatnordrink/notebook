*`Goals` are based on actions taken in the `vs` period.*

##FB
	Tested:
		* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
	3/25
		* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 

		### Next
		* A/B creative
		* Test different call to actions. 


## Google
	3/25 
		vs Feb 8 - Mar 25th
		### Goals 
		* Get over Depression: conv up, cost/conv down (Now 10%, $3.28)
		* General: cost/conv down (Now $2.07) (508 conversions for $1,055)
		* Apps: cost/conv down, conv up (Now $2.80, 9.28%)
		* Social: ($1.89/13.46%)
		* (Also paused two low-performing ads; both had long text.)

		### Next
		* If above is successful at improving overall cost/conversion and click-through rate ($1.96, 18.18%), start focussing on increasing the spend without increasing cost/conversion. (Currently 672 conversions for $1,317). Options: 
			* Increase the target CPA slightly, see what happens.
			* See if there's a way to enable dynamic target CPA within a certain range. 
			* Test new ad groups, optimize until they perform as well as the above; this would result in expansion, ideally. 
		* Back of target CPA (see below), hold the rest steady, see if profitability increases. (Back off to $1.30, compare to this period.)

		### Notes
		* Eddie increased the target CPA from 1.30 to 1.50, and overall budget. Budget shouldn't affect anything, but increasing target CPA will throw off the above tests.
