## Custom audiences
* These may overlap each other, depending on their criteria. Avoid this by excluding.
* Can test audience overlap with Audiences -> Actions -> Show Audience Overlap 

## Ad levels
* Ads within ad sets automatically compete against each other. 
* If ads under different ad sets are targeting the same audience, keep them from competing against one another by compiling them into a single ad set.
