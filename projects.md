* CLI knowledge base, Python
* CLI Timeline, python
* Replicate above two in JS, just for practice
* CLI library, python/js (enter term, associated docs pop up.) Could put things like paywall error codes in it. 

* Node program to take all space-separated words (or by line?) in a doc and return those not present in both docs. Use fsreadstream, make words into arrays.

## React/Docker (Then Vue, Flask, Kubernetes)

* PHQ9
* Simple bird program
