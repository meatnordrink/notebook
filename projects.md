* CLI knowledge base, Python
* CLI Timeline, python
* Replicate above two in JS, just for practice
* CLI library, python/js (enter term, associated docs pop up.) Could put things like paywall error codes in it. 

* Node program to take all space-separated words (or by line?) in a doc and return those not present in both docs. Use fsreadstream, make words into arrays. This is probably already possible using bash commands, but whatever. Idea is to be able to see what variables are unique in both docs. Could make the same thing in Python for fun. 

* ! - make tool to input js regex and export matches. 

## CSS

* Make a dark theme for Stylus/ish for the Material-UI docs pages.

## Node

* Make a program to convert text in various formats to other useful formats. (js)
    * Lines (no spaces) to array of strings - `^(.*)\n^(.*)\n^(.*)`
    * 
* Make a program to convert GT (or at least certain kinds of GT blocks) back into html. basic text; bold, italic, links.

## SQL
* Expand on current sql.sh, make into a program for recording finance info (perhaps add bash bit to also record in argent.md), so set up to send entry or retrieve all in readable form, using nodeSQL.

## React/Docker (Then Vue, Flask, Kubernetes)

* PHQ9
* Simple bird program
* **Make linearGauge component into OS repo**

## OS

* Make linear gauge into open source repo, npm module
