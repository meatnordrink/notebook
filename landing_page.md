# Landing Page
(Merge this with AndyWork copy; merge this whole repo)?
## Ideas
* Vary the first testimonial shown (only one visible on splash(only on iPhone X))
* Try analytics at bottom of page. Some or all. 
* Try some solution to allow .webp images. (Could just ignore Safari desktop...or maybe serve different on all desktop....? 
   Yes. Apply .jpg to all desktop; use iOS-selector for .webp)
