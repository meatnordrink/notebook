* New EM for high-performing keywords from BM
    * if they don't perform as EM, try phrase
* Add negative keywords from other longer campaigns into depression base campaign
    - Done, Depression BMM.
    ? Does not apply to Depression EM, because `Depression EM;Depression General` will only show for those exact keywords, yeah?
* Filter search terms by those with less than 1 conversion. Remove those that are irrelevant; check back on the others in a few month, see if there are clearer losers. (This is at the ad group level.)
    - Did for Depression BMM and EM. Saved probably $7 over four months... :)
* logo on landing page - image plus text
* campaign level-exclusion for uplift loans, travel - phrase match '' on brand and brand+generic. (Exclude uplift login?)
    - Done. `"uplift loans" "uplift travel" "uplift desk" across brand, brand + generic.` Did not exclude `uplift login`. 
* Examine where ad relevance is low
* Ad creative variants to ad groups; vary one line only. 
    - Sort of did this; expanded the "testimonial" creative that was introduced recently and did well.
* IF possible - look at uploading actual customer lists as custom audiences. 
* Call google, try to get us whitelisted for custom audiences. - 1-866-2GOOGLE (1-866-246-6453)
