Ad notes

Differences

- Audience for old is completed sign-up. 

- Audience for new is finished onboard, clicked to continue. 

    - Creating this audience for new account would be more limited. But could try. 


- Create campaign based on finished sign-up audience. (Imported?)
- Try a target-cost campaign
