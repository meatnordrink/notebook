Features to implement if we do end up sticking with the web version. 

* Notifications for renewals on web
* Default behavior = "yes" on pop-up when switching devices
* replace `iosApp` with `platformPurchased` where appropriate
* Pop-up for homescreen badge
* Increase gamification with forum; add liking a post, replying to someone elses, etc. as tasks in daily digest. (If we want to promote forum.)
