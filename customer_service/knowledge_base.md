## Extending user's subscriptions
* Can only do this through Braintree, really, and only for user's *next* subscription: https://www.notion.so/Give-paying-users-a-free-month-of-UpLift-in-Braintree-025c8534e5a74c3dbe497f3e93ec4f78
* Otherwise, have to have them cancel their subscription, and then give them lifetime free access. 
* Generally, going to switch over to giving partial refunds.
## Partial Refunds
* Can do on Android (for most subscriptions - be sure to enable the toggle), Braintree; can't on iOS. 
## Refunds
* Easy on Braintree, Android; through the various consoles. 
* Apple: User must request. 
## Free access
* iOS: 
    1. Have them request a refund
    2. Have them cancel their subscription
    3. After the subscription has been cancelled, open the user lookup program and use it to set their paid-through date far in the future.
