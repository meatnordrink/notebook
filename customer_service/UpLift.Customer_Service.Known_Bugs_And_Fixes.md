## "No Internet Connection" GT message
* Personal data has exceeded database storage limit (for users with lots of data). Working on getting more data for a fix. 

## "Unable to log in. Please make sure you're connected to the internet." 
* I think this is due to unconfirmed accounts. If they started about 7 days ago, ask them to reconfirm. (Send link.)

## App freezes, progress lost; reinstalling fixes the issue temporarily.
* If the user is using the app version, this could be due to low local storage. From Lyudmil: 
> The phone tries to store all of the data locally in case it ever needs to load while offline. What if he doesn’t have enough storage?
> If he’s low enough on storage, it would make the phone slow and that could cause the kinds of problems he’s describing.
> And it would then make sense that reinstalling works for a while, until locally stored data builds up again. 

## This page is not set up to run this program.

* This can be caused by ad blockers (including the defaults included in Brave, etc.). (Dec 2019)

## User repeatedly sent to sign-in screen

As of Jan 2020, Lyudmil says (yet to verify):

I only know of one cause of this, and it's Safari blocking third-party
cookies.

I suggest asking her to check Safari's cookie settings. She can do so by
doing the following:

1. Opening the Settings app
2. Scrolling down to find Safari and clicking on it
3. Scrolling down to the Privacy and Security section

There she should see the following settigs:

* Prevent Cross-Site Tracking
* Block All Cookies

If "Block All Cookies" is on, that would be the reason she can't log in
– turning it off should fix the login problem for her.

If it's already off, then that's a new issue. It would be good to know
whether "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" is on, but to resolve this problem
we should really speak to her instead.
