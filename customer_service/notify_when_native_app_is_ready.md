To redeem it, open the App Store app on your iPhone, press the person icon in the top right, press 'Redeem Gift Card or Code' and then enter the code in to redeem it.

You'll get a confusing email about a subscription that will last a year, but nothing will actually be charged and the subscription won't be automatically renewed in a year.

### Offer Coupons (maybe) 
* robinrod.rabuck@gmail.com - already gave her free access, so don't necessarily have to give free. 
* starnbergersee@outlook.com - also refunded and gave free, so "". (Maybe discount coupons for these people, if we have them?)
* upliftemail@gmail.com - Ana T. Not sure if she wants access, but could offer. She was really far in the program, run keeps ending.
