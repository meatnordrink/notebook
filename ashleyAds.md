~~I had a look at those campaigns. The structure is in the right place. I wouldn't have a separate campaign for "CBT For Depression". My suggestion is to make that as a separate ad group within your CBT campaigns.~~
    
    --test change!
    
~~As for the campaigns. The Broad campaign is currently using pure broad match keyword settings. Change those to BMM to keep things anchored in. To do that place a + before every word. eg. +CBT or +CBT +depression~~

    

~~Also, the exact match campaign has exact and phrase in there. I'd split those out. If you are going to use phrase then at least make a Phrase match specific campaign. It again comes down to control of spend and relevancy.~~

    
~~Regarding your question around the creative, the key use of paths and those headlines is to aid relevance in Google's eyes. The 3rd headline doesn't always show by the way. I wouldn't worry about is seeming spammy. Use it more as a way to a) take up more space in the SERP b) convey more info about your brand and product. And the paths are just vanity URL's. The don't need to actually exist as domains either.~~

~~Quick final one. I saw the ad copy in your new example campaigns and it looks good. My one piece of advice would be to ensure you have that call to action for the searcher in the copy.~~



## To do later/ideas: 

* After seeing how $1.50 performs, lower target CPA to $1.30

* Try a phrase-match specific campaign, if we don't do one now. (Or don't, maybe? Could just try.)


* Try campaign with competitor keywords



* Do a Search Query Report (SQR) on BMM!!! (Is this the same as the "Search Term" tab under keywords?)
  * Make irrelevants into negative keywords
  * Consider adding low-converting/high-cost search strings as negative keywords
  * For high-performing strings, make into it's own exact match campaign;
  (Note: I did run one of these, but so far, nothing has more than 2 conversions, and only a couple of those...so I think I need more data?) 

* Try adding "for Android/iPhone" to relevant campaigns, once we're promoting our app again. 
* Try adding "free" to any campaigns with app in the name. 

## Questions
* Approach to take if CPA is significantly exceeding target CPA?

* Declining spend w/time?

* How to check if a word is a variant? i.e., depressed/depression?

* With fight/overcome/beat depression - variants that are harder to use in add copy like "battle", "cope" - separate campaign, or include as search terms for one of the fight/overcome/beat group?
  * Same question, but with "therapy/treatment." A lot of people are going to search for it, but we really *can't* use it in our ads. Best strategy? 

* App Install Campaigns - can't specify keywords??? Or networks? Or anything???
  * ~~Try creating another one from scratch~~ Yep, can't specify anything. 
  * (Doesn't spend)
    
* Phrase match campaigns any use?

* Is a Search Query Report the same as the "Search Terms" tab on the keywords page? 

* For the "brand-specific" campaign, I'm seeing really high search ranking and ad interaction, but hardly any conversions. Does this imply that I'm getting a lot of irrelevant clicks?
