### Server-side
* Replace our current hosting (VM running Express) with a container running nginx for increased speed & future portability. (Replace web page first, see how it goes; then try with a single program from launch.uplift.app, see if there's any improvement in performance.) (Still have to load the interpreter...)

### React
* React version of a simple section (Food and Mood) to test load times vs current GT webview. (But still a webview, so fits with current app architecture relatively well.) Could be a significant improvement; and would give us total freedom. (Could just build the same in Swift/Java; but this approach would keep our content as a single codebase.)
* Build a separate app in React, to test a unified codebase. Something like a food journal, mindfulness, whatever. 

### Swift
* Something I could do in the current app? 

### Java/Kotlin
* "" the new Android app
