# FB

### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25
* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 
* Aug 2019: Instagram Feed Ads bombed.
* Desktop only - July 2019. Failed badly. Could try with more targeted creative/to specific audiences. 
* "Download" CTA doesn't seem to do as well as 'learn more' or 'sign up'.

### Testing

* New IG Stories ad group, Sept. 19th. If does okay, experiment with different call-to-actions for best ads. 
 * If these don't spend, consider forcing spend by running as an a/b.
* New Sept creative for onboard-end, sign-up. Experiment calls to action, shift evidence (see below) or free text to forefront.
 * Whatever does well from this or IG Stories, try on retargeting groups. 
* Put all retargeting in one campaign; added a group retargeting for pageviews.
--pageviews failed to spend; created a new campaign with a custom conversion for website loads.  
* **CHECK** Turned off old ad group in signed-up campaign; check to see that spend is still good. If average CPA goes near $2, turn it back on. 


### To check/Do
* natural depression campaign

* For retargeting: Think on, come up with some ideas for best content to serve to retargeting audiences. Run a/b's, perhaps. 

* Think on/discuss best way of adding new creative. Keep budget optimization? Split budgets? 

* REST OF ASHLEYS REC'S: Carousel, regional (also, try to get Google to whitelist us for audiences.)

* If sign-up audience ultimately seems better than onboard-end, aim Instagram at that. (Consider keeping onboard-end, but with a lower bid cap.)

* Next - try putting IG stories creative in FB feed ads;they had low costs there. (cross competition; same audience..?) (maybe just the images...?)
* If costs remain high on two main campaigns, reduce target bids. 

* (Sept. 10) Added "evidence-focus" ads to retargeting campaigns. **Check**
    * Seem to be doing very well (Sept. 19th) - try on other campaigns when results of new pics in. 
    --In progress
* Test IG ads targeted solely at men (perhaps in a certain region, to go with regional campaign; and exclude from other campaigns.)

* Look through; if ads consistently run badly on weekends, turn off then. 

### Next
* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.) -- IN PROGRESS
* Vary text in creative. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try dynamic creative again.

* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a carousel; or static text with pics of diverse people cylcing through. Try running it on Instagram. 
* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)
* Try busting out most successful ads into own campaigns --(Why, again? Maybe check on Search Focused.pdf)

* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.

* Consider setting the target of the retargeting-purchases campaign as pageviews. 

# RETARGETING CAMPAIGNS (FB Only)
## In Progress

## To-do: 
* Launch retarget campaign for IG
* Check analytics for sign-ups, purchases for 'clicked' campaign once `utm_source` parameters are passing through sign-up. 
* "" for 'bought' campaign; currently very little visibility past landing page here, as most users will skip the onboard entirely. 

## Findings
* For the "clicked" audiences, where the metrics work well, looks like the Google and FB #'s match up perfectly. 



# Google

## Tested
* Responsive ads - not great so far. Not horrible, but worse than expanded text. Tried in Depression BMM;Depression General, and Mood Journal EM & BMM;Mood Tracker. In the latter, increased spend, but at very high CPR.
    - but, seem to be working in CBT campaigns??
### Keywords Tested: 
* Free Mood Tracking (No spend as of Aug 2019)
* (Neg) `+CBT +Self +Online` - spent nothing.

## In Progress: 

* See below.
* Increased target CPA late Jul 23rd. (May only have taken effect 26)
- **->** Seems to have had positive effect; spend increased, with only a small increase in CPA.
  **->** On Sept 18th, switched to monthly budget and increased by $100/month.

## To check on: 

* See above. 

* (Sep 9) Added explicit price ad variant to `depression BMM; depression general`. ***Check***
   - Explicit cost ad seems to be doing well. Copied to: 
     * `depression EMM: depression general`
	 * `CBT BMM: all groups` (customized)
* Added Responsive ads to CBT EMM campaign, both ad groups. 


**Get out of depression**:
* (Check EMM; doing better than BMM.) Looks like `depression/program` does better than `get_out_of/depression`. Changed several to this (Sept 18). If this pattern continues, try a/b'ing rational (rather than relevance-focussed) url's on other, large campaigns (where they aren't).
**Depression Help**: 
 * Added second ad. 
 * See neg. below
 * Try breaking out a campaign for `how to help {x} with depression`
**Depression self-help**: 
* Added `self-help` negative keyword to `depression help`; see if performance improves. (9/18)
**Fight Depression**
* Lots of ad variants. Check out. 
**CBT BMM: All groups**
* Added explicit price ad. 
* Consider turning off responsive search ad on `CBT` group. Left on for now, as it's increasing spend for the account, I think...but it's costing significantly more. 
**How to get out of depression**
* Created, Sept. 19th. Check on gen performance, ad variants. If doing well, create a 'coping' campaign, provided it's still the top search term in gen depression.


* Switched to monthly budgeting for main campaign, 9/18. Check out. 
* Increased budget from 1620 to 1520, Sept. 18. 
* Re: above - maybe just try a campaign for `how to ... depression` [fight cope get rid not be snap out pull yourself out]

## To try:

* Look at Google Guy's advice, think through application

* Check out Google Trends, apply

* natural depression campaign

* depression therapy campaign

* break out cognitive behavioral therapy from cbt?

* Different bid strategies (Target ROAS?)
* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`
* Try customizing extensions to match ads for better relevance scores. 
* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
	* Expand on this - try deep-linking at some point; ask Danielle how possible it is. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
* `How to`...`depression naturally` campaign. (Check out `Beat depression` for example search terms.)




# Q's for Ashley

* Since Aug 28th 2019, started disabling campaigns that were spending little but doing nothing. Cool?
* Different bid strategies?








		* Figure out why the app install campaign isn't performing. Says no download conversion action is set up; figure out how to do this. (Ask Ashley.)
			* Set up app conversion event for Google Play installs, once we're actually listed on the Play store. 

		* Create anxiety campaign
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.  


# Conclusions (some tentative)


## FB
* Instagram ads seem to have higher cost-per-onboard-end, but lower per sign-up. Yay. (July '19, preliminary) (Aug 27 - but this seems to be dropping; prob necessary to keep creative varied.)
* Sign-up audience is slightly underperforming onboard-end audience...but it might be worth it to have a different audience to aim at, to increase spend. (July '19, preliminary - will sign-ups improve after I winnow the ads?)
