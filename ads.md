##FB
### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25
* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 
* Aug 2019: Instagram Feed Ads bombed. 

### Testing

* July 2019 - Desktop only, sign-up based audience, new creative
* "Free" creative
* Retargeting
* Instagram stories, varied creative. 
* Switched IG Feed campaign from bid cap to lowest cost, Aug 12th (was not spending).
* Onboard - lowest cost campaign; disabled fern `learn more`, added fern `signed up`, Aug 12th. (Also added to bid-cap onboard-end signed-up audience & clicked download audience.) ***check***

### To check/Do

* Instagram costs seem like they're creeping up. Reduced spend; try new creative variations. 
* Turned off two high-spending IG Stories ads, Aug 27; check on within-group spend.

		* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
		* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
		* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.)
		* Vary text in creative.
		* Try dynamic creative again.
		* Try a/b'ing "bid cap" vs "lowest cost", other strategies. **IN PROGRESS, CHECK**
		* From Ashley:
			* Create a campaign to retarget non-converters
			* Custom creative for ads in this campaign?
		* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a video. Try running it on Instagram.
		* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)

One to start?) Consider trying the same with a video; or static text with pics of diverse people cylcing through. Try running it on Instagram. -- IN PROGRESS -- **Results: Cost-per-onboard-end is higher, but cost-per-signup is lower; so these may actually be a better avenue.**
	* **Try the same thing, but with a FB or IG Feed ad (text as text, pic of person - same pic)**
* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)
* Try busting out most successful ads into own campaigns

		* Create IG Feed Ad Campaign with same assets as Stories. **IN PROGRESS, CHECK**
		* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.
		* Try targeting signed-up, while we're still on web.

		* Consider setting the target of the retargeting-purchases campaign as pageviews. 


## Google

## Tested
* Responsive ads - not great so far. Not horrible, but worse than expanded text. Tried in Depression BMM;Depression General, and Mood Journal EM & BMM;Mood Tracker. In the latter, increased spend, but at very high CPR.
### Keywords Tested: 
* Free Mood Tracking (No spend as of Aug 2019)
* (Neg) `+CBT +Self +Online` - spent nothing.

## In Progress: 

- Depression General, BMM
	- **?**Check out how new customer testimonial ad does.
		- **->** Did quite well in Depression BMM, Depression General. Expanded to (Aug 28): 
			- Depression BMM, Depression App
			- "", Beat Depression
			- "", Fight Depression
			- Depression EM, Depression General
		- **CHECK**
	- *** new `mood tracking` ad group in BMM. *** 
		- **->** `mood tracking` did well, relatively. Disabled ;Mood Tracker in Mood Journal BMM in favor of ;Mood Tracking.
* Increased target CPA late Jul 23rd. (May only have taken effect 26)
- **->** Seems to have had positive effect; spend increased, with only a small increase in CPA.

## To check on: 

* See above. 
* In `Depression BMM;Fight Depression`, created ad variation, swapped Fight Depression line and The Depression App that Works line (order). See if that improves relevance. (Was a 7.) - AUg 28
* From `Depression BMM; Depression Self-help`, broke out `+depression +help` into own ad group, tailored url extensions from help to self-help. Ditto for `Depression EM`. Aug 28



## To try:

* Different bid strategies (Target ROAS?)
* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`
* Try customizing extensions to match ads for better relevance scores. 
* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
					



# Q's for Ashley

* Since Aug 28th 2019, started disabling campaigns that were spending little but doing nothing. Cool?
* Different bid strategies?








		* Figure out why the app install campaign isn't performing. Says no download conversion action is set up; figure out how to do this. (Ask Ashley.)
			* Set up app conversion event for Google Play installs, once we're actually listed on the Play store. 

		* Create anxiety campaign
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.  


# Conclusions (some tentative)


## FB
* Instagram ads seem to have higher cost-per-onboard-end, but lower per sign-up. Yay. (July '19, preliminary) (Aug 27 - but this seems to be dropping; prob necessary to keep creative varied.)
* Sign-up audience is slightly underperforming onboard-end audience...but it might be worth it to have a different audience to aim at, to increase spend. (July '19, preliminary - will sign-ups improve after I winnow the ads?)
