*`Goals` are based on actions taken in the `vs` period.*

##FB
    ### Tested:
		* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
	3/25
		* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment.

    ### Testing

        * July 2019 - Desktop only, sign-up based audience, new creative
		* "Free" creative
		* Retargeting


	### Next
		* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
		* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
		* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.)
		* Vary text in creative.
		* Try dynamic creative again.
		* Try a/b'ing "bid cap" vs "lowest cost", other strategies.
		* From Ashley:
			* Create a campaign to retarget non-converters
			* Custom creative for ads in this campaign?
		* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a video. Try running it on Instagram.
		* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)


## Google



		## To-do:

		* Add a couple more responsive ads, monitor.

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.
