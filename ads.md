# FB

### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25
* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 
* Aug 2019: Instagram Feed Ads bombed. 

### Testing

* July 2019 - Desktop only, sign-up based audience, new creative
* "Free" creative
* Retargeting
* Instagram stories, varied creative. 
* Switched IG Feed campaign from bid cap to lowest cost, Aug 12th (was not spending).
* Onboard - lowest cost campaign; disabled fern `learn more`, added fern `signed up`, Aug 12th. (Also added to bid-cap onboard-end signed-up audience & clicked download audience.) ***check***

### To check/Do

* Instagram costs seem like they're creeping up. Reduced spend; try new creative variations. 
    * Remaining higher; re-introduced an initially-tossed creative. (Black woman.) Check that out. 
* Turned off higher-cost ad (Download CTA) for lowest-cost ad campaign. Was 2.19 vs 2.41, 163 total conversions (in last 14 days). ***Check***
* (Sept. 9) Increased signed-up audience budget to $40
* (Sept. 10) Added "evidence-focus" ads to retargeting campaigns. **Check**
* Turned off two high-spending IG Stories ads, Aug 27; check on within-group spend. 

### Next
* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.) -- IN PROGRESS
* Vary text in creative. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try dynamic creative again.
* Try a/b'ing "bid cap" vs "lowest cost", other strategies. 
* From Ashley: 
	* Create a campaign to retarget non-converters -- IN PROGRESS 
	* Custom creative for ads in this campaign? 
* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a video; or static text with pics of diverse people cylcing through. Try running it on Instagram. -- IN PROGRESS -- **Results: Cost-per-onboard-end is higher, but cost-per-signup is lower; so these may actually be a better avenue.**
	* **Try the same thing, but with a FB or IG Feed ad (text as text, pic of person - same pic)**
* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)
* Try busting out most successful ads into own campaigns


		* Try Audience Network-only campaign, see how it does.
		* Try targeting signed-up, while we're still on web. - IN PROGRESS

		* Consider setting the target of the retargeting-purchases campaign as pageviews. 


# Google

## Tested
* Responsive ads - not great so far. Not horrible, but worse than expanded text. Tried in Depression BMM;Depression General, and Mood Journal EM & BMM;Mood Tracker. In the latter, increased spend, but at very high CPR.
### Keywords Tested: 
* Free Mood Tracking (No spend as of Aug 2019)
* (Neg) `+CBT +Self +Online` - spent nothing.

## In Progress: 

* See below.
* Increased target CPA late Jul 23rd. (May only have taken effect 26)
- **->** Seems to have had positive effect; spend increased, with only a small increase in CPA.

## To check on: 

* See above. 

* (Sep 9) Added explicit price ad variant to `depression BMM; depression general`. ***Check***
   - Explicit cost ad seems to be doing well. Copied to: 
     * `depression EMM: depression general`
	 * `CBT BMM: all groups` (customized)


**Get out of depression**:
* (Check EMM; doing better than BMM.) Looks like `depression/program` does better than `get_out_of/depression`. Changed several to this. If this pattern continues, try a/b'ing rational (rather than relevance-focussed) url's on other, large campaigns (where they aren't).
**Depression Help**: 
 * Added second ad. 
 * See neg. below
 * Try breaking out a campaign for `how to help {x} with depression`
**Depression self-help**: 
* Added `self-help` negative keyword to `depression help`; see if performance improves. (9/18)
**Fight Depression**
* Lots of ad variants. Check out. 
**CBT BMM: All groups**
* Added explicit price ad. 
* Consider turning off responsive search ad on `CBT` group. Left on for now, as it's increasing spend for the account, I think...but it's costing significantly more. 

* Switched to monthly budgeting for main campaign, 9/18. Check out. 
* Increased budget from 1620 to 1520, Sept. 18. 
* Re: above - maybe just try a campaign for `how to ... depression` [fight cope get rid not be snap out pull yourself out]

## To try:

* Different bid strategies (Target ROAS?)
* Break out `mdd`, `major depressive disorder` from Depression BMM and EM.
* "" `getting depression`
* Try customizing extensions to match ads for better relevance scores. 
* Consider custom landing pages to improve relevance scores. Try one or two at first. 
	* Expand on this - try deep-linking at some point; ask Danielle how possible it is. 
* `Depression and anxiety` campaign. 
* `How to`...`depression naturally` campaign. (Check out `Beat depression` for example search terms.)
					



# Q's for Ashley

* Since Aug 28th 2019, started disabling campaigns that were spending little but doing nothing. Cool?
* Different bid strategies?








		* Figure out why the app install campaign isn't performing. Says no download conversion action is set up; figure out how to do this. (Ask Ashley.)
			* Set up app conversion event for Google Play installs, once we're actually listed on the Play store. 

		* Create anxiety campaign
		

## Some general shit:

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway.
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.  


# Conclusions (some tentative)


## FB
* Instagram ads seem to have higher cost-per-onboard-end, but lower per sign-up. Yay. (July '19, preliminary) (Aug 27 - but this seems to be dropping; prob necessary to keep creative varied.)
* Sign-up audience is slightly underperforming onboard-end audience...but it might be worth it to have a different audience to aim at, to increase spend. (July '19, preliminary - will sign-ups improve after I winnow the ads?)
