*`Goals` are based on actions taken in the `vs` period.*

##FB
### Tested:
* Broader (2-5%) lookalike (failed badly.)
3/25
* Tested reducing placements on Onboard CA group. Also created iOS-only group. Budget also increased to ~220/day; this may lower efficiency of all. May have to re-test as relative in new environment. 
* Aug 2019: Instagram Feed Ads bombed. 

### Testing

* July 2019 - Desktop only, sign-up based audience, new creative
* "Free" creative
* Retargeting
* Instagram stories, varied creative. 
* Switched IG Feed campaign from bid cap to lowest cost, Aug 12th (was not spending).
* Onboard - lowest cost campaign; disabled fern `learn more`, added fern `signed up`, Aug 12th. (Also added to bid-cap onboard-end signed-up audience & clicked download audience.) ***check***

### To check/Do

* Turned off "free" creative in signed-up audience July 26th. Standard-sign-up was $1.27 at that point; Fern was 1.80, but spending $200 vs $10. See if this changes post-26th shut-down of "free" creative. Could consider shutting off fern and seeing what happens. 



### Next
* A/B creative - IN PROGRESS; could do more.
* Test different call to actions. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try creating another (better) instagram-specific ad; make it's own campaign. (maybe promote app download, if we're doing it then.) -- IN PROGRESS
* Vary text in creative. -- IN PROGRESS
* Try dynamic creative again.
* Try a/b'ing "bid cap" vs "lowest cost", other strategies. 
* From Ashley: 
	* Create a campaign to retarget non-converters -- IN PROGRESS 
	* Custom creative for ads in this campaign? 
* Try an ad "telling a story" about someone who reduced their depression with UpLift; feature a user quote, a pic of a young woman/old woman (maybe try both? Or in separate groups? Or campaigns? One to start?) Consider trying the same with a video; or static text with pics of diverse people cylcing through. Try running it on Instagram. -- IN PROGRESS -- **Results: Cost-per-onboard-end is higher, but cost-per-signup is lower; so these may actually be a better avenue.**
	* **Try the same thing, but with a FB or IG Feed ad (text as text, pic of person - same pic)**
* Consider trying to reduce audience size even further (to get frequency - this is Ashley's rec, that if it's around 1, your audience is too big.)
* Try busting out most successful ads into own campaigns


## Google

## In Progress: 

* Add a couple more responsive ads, monitor. 
	* Responsive ads currently in: 
		- Depression General, BMM
			- *** Check out how this does with increased target CPA *** 
			- Also check out how new customer testimonial ad does.
		- Mood Tracker, EM, BMM
			- *** Also check on new `free mood tracker` keywords, new `mood tracking` ad group in BMM. *** 
		- CBT, BMM (`+CBT +Self +Online` was added only to this ad group, and not as a negative keyword. ***CHECK OUT***)
	* Increased target CPA late Jul 23rd. (May only have taken effect 26)

## To try:

* Different bid strategies (Target ROAS?)
					



## Some general shit: 

* Try shutting down one or the other of the campaigns for a week, while changing nothing else. (Past tests have suggested people from each campaign convert similarly, but this may have changed.)
  * Could try adding utm_source back in while on web-only pathway. 
  * The bounce rates for google cpc vs facebook suggest that Google clicks may be more valuable, as far as website clicks; but I don't totally trust these numbers, and also, it doesn't mean they buy more.  


# Conclusions (some tentative)


## FB
* Instagram ads seem to have higher cost-per-onboard-end, but lower per sign-up. Yay. (July '19, preliminary)
* Sign-up audience is slightly underperforming onboard-end audience...but it might be worth it to have a different audience to aim at, to increase spend. (July '19, preliminary - will sign-ups improve after I winnow the ads?)
